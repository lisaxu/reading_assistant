Anaerobic exercise is a type of exercise that breaks down glucose in the body without using oxygen, as anaerobic means “without oxygen”.[1] In practical terms, this means that anaerobic exercise is harder but shorter than aerobic exercise.

The biochemistry of anaerobic exercise involves a process called glycolysis, in which glucose is converted to adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the primary source of energy for cellular reactions.[2]

Lactic acid is produced at an increased rate during anaerobic exercise, causing it to build up quickly. The build-up of lactate above the lactate threshold (also called anaerobic threshold) is a major contributor to muscle fatigue.

Anaerobic exercise may be used by personal trainers to help their clients build endurance, muscle strength, and power.[3][4]
