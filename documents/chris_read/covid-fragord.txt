90 a. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak first detected in
91 Wuhan, China, in December has continued to spread throughout China and
92 the world. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
93 assesses that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is thought to spread mainly from
94 person-to-person. Transmission is assessed to occur between people who
95 are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet) or via respiratory
96 droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes which
97 droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or
98 possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
99
100 (1) As of 23 Feb 20, The CDC assesses, that it might be possible that a
101 person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the
102 virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their
103 eyes.
104
105 (2) On 31 Jan 20, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and
106 Human Services (HHS) declared a public health emergency for the United
107 States.
108
109 (3) On 11 Mar 20, the World Health Organization declared 2019-nCoV a
110 pandemic. According to the CDC, “
111 112
113 (4) On 21 Mar 20, the CDC assigned Japan a Travel Health Notice Level
114 3.
115
116 (5) 117
118
119 b. As the U.S. Armed Forces in Japan, we inherently work in close quarters,
120 and our personnel are the primary resource for performance of our treaty
121 obligations. Focused on minimizing risk to mission and risk to force health
122 and in fulfillment of my responsibilities as the commander who has TACON
123 for force health protection, I direct the following measures. Violations by
124 military personnel are subject to punishment under Article 92, UCMJ as
125 violations of a lawful general order. Failures to comply with this order by
126 U.S. civilian employees may result in disciplinary administrative action
127 and/or a determination that the employee has failed to adjust to the
128 overseas environment. Violations by dependents may result in
129 administrative sanctions, up to and including loss of command sponsorship
130 and an early return of dependents.

  On 24 Mar 20, USINDOPACOM in order to align the force, set the
 baseline at HPCON CHARLIE for the AOR.

132 2. Mission. COMUSFJ has FPCON and HPCON authority for Japan, directs
133 heightened FPCON and HPCON levels across Japan to protect the force, and
134 maintains combat power/projection across Japan.
135
136 3. Execution. 137
138 a. Commander’s Intent. It is incumbent on ALL USFJ-affiliated personnel to
139 do their part to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 transmission by practicing
140 heightened hygiene measures, consider limiting or cancelling meetings,
141 training events, formations, and large social gatherings. Total commitment
142 of the entire USFJ population and personal integrity and discipline will be
143 required to contain the spread of the virus. USFJ will take all appropriate
144 measures to protect the force, our families, and our community.
145
146 b. Concept of the Operation. FRAGORD 003 Our number one priority is to
147 protect the force. We have made significant progress in our containment
148 efforts of COVID-19. One key to our success has been compliance with our
149 Force Public Health Order. However, the conditions throughout Japan
150 warrant continuing effort, focus, and vigilance. After deliberate command
151 and staff assessment and receiving the Public Health Emergency Officer's
152 recommendation: I am declaring a Public Health Emergency (PHE) for
153 Japan in accordance with DoD Instruction (DoDI) 6200.03, “Public Health
154 Emergency Management (PHEM) Within the DoD.” The PHE will
155 automatically terminate on May 15, 2020, unless it is renewed and
156 republished or sooner terminated by me. This order supersedes the previous
157 PHE declaration for Base Clusters 1 and 6 issued on 06 APR 20.
158
159 c. USFJ retains responsibility for ensuring appropriate Force Health
160 Protection Measures are in place for the Japan AOR, as the situation
161 dictates.

the U.S. Department of Defense facility within Japan with the capability to conduct testing of samples for COVID-19. In order to reduce the time to get test results and ensure consistent testing processes are not influenced by local capacity or Government of Japan restrictions, all U.S. military medical treatment facilities (MTFs) in Japan should use the Yokosuka lab as their primary testing site.
(a) FRAGORD 002 USFJ J4 established a DoD air bridge to reduce transit time for COVID-19 samples. Camp Humphreys, Korea and other CONUS- based military laboratories will serve as secondary sites or when demands exceed capacity at Yokosuka.

(5) CHANGE FRAGORD 005 Appendix 2 to Annex A is an Entry Letter into Japan for Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) members. This is to be used with airlines to provide a reassurance that SOFA status personnel are authorized entry to Japan, notwithstanding any prohibitions on entry by the Government of Japan. The letter is not to be shown to immigration authorities. Entry to Japan only requires documents set forth in the Foreign Clearance Guide. The Service member’s component will provide either Government Operated Vehicle (GOV) or Privately Owned Vehicle (POV) from the port of entry to a USFJ facility. Onward movement by commercial air is prohibited prior to completing a ROM for 14 days. Onward movement by MILAIR prior to completing the ROM for 14 days is permitted
(6) FRAGORD 003 During this extremely unusual time when movement of personnel brought to Japan has been stopped for dependents, the service components and 5 AF are to extend the SOFA status for everyone whose sponsor has departed Japan. This extension is to be through 1 Jul 20 or until 30 days after the stop movement is lifted, whichever is later. Ensure that entry/exit stamps are updated to reflect this extension.
