RMKS/1. THIS MESSAGE UPDATES AND REPLACES THE ORIGINAL U.S. NAVY
STANDARDIZED OPERATIONAL GUIDANCE ISSUED IN REF A.  REF A IS CANCELLED.  KEY UPDATES:
MODIFIES RETURN TO WORK CRITERIA BASED ON INCREASED UNDERSTANDING OF THE
COVID-19 THREAT; CLARIFIES POST DEPLOYMENT ROM CRITERIA; AND, INCLUDES
ADDITIONAL BUBBLE TO BUBBLE TRANSFER CONSIDERATIONS.

1.A. TO INCREASE PROBABILITY OF A COVID-FREE MISSION READY CREW, UNITS WILL
ADHERE TO THE FOLLOWING STANDARDIZED OPERATIONAL GUIDANCE.  THESE DATA
DRIVEN
RISK MITIGATION MEASURES PROVIDE COMMANDERS THE TOOLS TO PREVENT, AND WHEN
NECESSARY, CONTAIN COVID-19 IMPACT TO SAFELY AND CONFIDENTLY REMAIN ON
MISSION.  FLEET, TYCOM, AND OPERATIONAL COMMANDERS MAY ISSUE MORE SPECIFIC
GUIDANCE TO UNITS WITHIN THEIR RESPECTIVE AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY.  THIS
GUIDANCE BUILDS ON REFS (B) AND (C) WHILE INCORPORATING GUIDANCE FROM
REFS (D) THROUGH (F).  IT WILL GUIDE INDIVIDUAL AND UNIT HEALTH PROTECTION,
PRESERVE OPERATIONAL READINESS, AND PROTECT SHIPMATES, INSTALLATIONS, AND
COMMUNITIES FROM COVID-19 TRANSMISSION.  ALTHOUGH BIASED TOWARD THE
SHIPBOARD ENVIRONMENT, THIS GUIDANCE APPLIES TO ALL PERSONNEL AND UNITS DEPLOYING TO
AND FROM HOMEPORT (ORIGINATING UNIT LOCATION FOR RESERVE PERSONNEL).  IT
DOES NOT APPLY TO ROUTINE TRAVEL (E.G., PCS, TDY, TAD) UNLESS THE TRAVELER IS A
DEPLOYING INDIVIDUAL OR IS ASSIGNED TO OR WILL BE WORKING ABOARD AN
OPERATIONAL UNIT.  ADHERENCE TO THIS STANDARDIZED GUIDANCE INCLUDES
ACCOUNTING FOR SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES INVOLVING CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES OR CONTRACTORS PER
PARAGRAPH 9.  EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES MAY NECESSITATE WAIVERS TO THIS
GUIDANCE TO MEET EMERGENT OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS.  THE NAVAL COMPONENT
COMMANDER (NCC) IS THE WAIVER AUTHORITY UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFICALLY
ADDRESSED.

2. DEFINITIONS.

2.A. COVID-19 CASE: A MEMBER DESIGNATED BY A MEDICAL PROVIDER BY ONE OF TWO
METHODS:  1) A POSITIVE COVID-19 LABORATORY TEST, OR 2) ASSESSED AS PRESUMED
POSITIVE PER THE COUNCIL OF STATE AND TERRITORIAL EPIDEMIOLOGIST(CSTE)
CRITERIA FOR A PROBABLE CASE.

2.B. PATIENT (OR PERSON) UNDER INVESTIGATION (PUI): AN INDIVIDUAL WITH SIGNS
OR SYMPTOMS OF COVID-19 WHO HAS A TEST RESULT PENDING OR WOULD HAVE BEEN
TESTED HAD A TEST BEEN AVAILABLE.  MEMBERS ARE NO LONGER A PUI WHEN THEY:
A) RECEIVE A NEGATIVE COVID-19 LAB TEST RESULT; OR, B) HAVE MET ALL CRITERIA
FOR RETURN TO WORK IN PARAGRAPH 7.D.  ASYMPTOMATIC INDIVIDUALS QUARANTINED
DUE TO CLOSE CONTACT WITH A COVID POSITIVE MEMBER ARE NOT CLASSIFIED PUI.
ASYMPTOMATIC INDIVIDUALS BEING TESTED FOR COVID-19 ARE NOT CONSIDERED PUIS
WHILE AWAITING TEST RESULTS.

2.C. HIGH-RISK PERSONNEL: THOSE INDIVIDUALS, DESIGNATED BY A MEDICAL
PROVIDER, THAT MEET THE CDC HIGH-RISK CRITERIA AVAILABLE
AT: HTTPS://WWW.CDC.GOV/CORONAVIRUS/2019-NCOV/NEED-EXTRA-PRECAUTIONS/PEOPLE-
AT-HIGHER-RISK.HTML   THIS LIST EVOLVES AS KNOWLEDGE OF COVID-19 GROWS AND
SHOULD BE CHECKED FREQUENTLY.

2.D. CLOSE CONTACT:  INDIVIDUALS IDENTIFIED AS BEING WITHIN APPROXIMATELY 6
FEET (2 METERS) OF A COVID-19 CASE FOR A PROLONGED PERIOD OF TIME (>15
MINUTES).  CLOSE CONTACT CAN OCCUR WHILE CARING FOR, LIVING WITH, VISITING, WORKING
WITH, OR SHARING A DENSELY POPULATED SPACE WITH A COVID-19 CASE.  CLOSE CONTACT
CAN ALSO BE ESTABLISHED VIA DIRECT CONTACT (E.G., BEING COUGHED OR SNEEZED UPON
BY A COVID-19 CASE).  DETERMINATION OF CLOSE CONTACT PRESUMES THE INTERACTION
TRANSPIRED DURING THE COVID-19 CASES POTENTIALLY INFECTIOUS PERIOD CURRENTLY
DEFINED AS 48 HOURS PRIOR TO SYMPTOM ONSET (OR FIRST POSITIVE TEST IF
ASYMPTOMATIC) TO THE TIME THE COVID-19 CASE IS PLACED IN ISOLATION.  SOME
EXAMPLES SPECIFIC TO THE SHIPBOARD ENVIRONMENT INCLUDE:  A) INDIVIDUALS
WITHIN THE COVID-19 CASES BERTHING AREA ASSIGNED AN ADJACENT RACK INCLUDING
DIRECTLY ACROSS A NARROW AISLE; B) PROLONGED INTERACTION WITHIN RELATIVELY
CONFINED SPACES INTERNAL TO THE SHIP (E.G., WORK SPACE, GALLEY, GYM,
SMOKING DECK, CHAPEL, ETC.).

2.E. MEDICAL SCREENING:  COVID-19 MEDICAL SCREENING SHOULD INCLUDE
EVALUATION FOR BOTH TYPICAL AND ATYPICAL SYMPTOMS. TYPICAL SYMPTOMS OF COVID-19
INCLUDE: COUGH, SHORTNESS OF BREATH OR DIFFICULTY BREATHING, FEVER, CHILLS, MUSCLE
PAIN, GASTROINTESTINAL DISTRESS, AND RECENT LOSS OF TASTE OR SMELL.
ATYPICAL SYMPTOMS OF COVID-19 INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: SORE THROAT,
RHINORRHEA (RUNNY NOSE), NASAL CONGESTION, NAUSEA, DIARRHEA, HEADACHE,
INCREASED CONFUSION, DIZZINESS, AND MALAISE. A COMPLETE LIST OF COVID-19
SYMPTOMS CAN BE FOUND AT:
HTTPS://WWW.CDC.GOV/CORONAVIRUS/2019-NCOV/SYMPTOMS-
TESTING/SYMPTOMS.HTML.

2.F. SELF-MONITORING. PER THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION
(CDC), SELF-MONITORING INCLUDES ASSESSING ONSET OF FEVER BY TAKING ONES TEMPERATURE
TWICE A DAY AND REMAINING ALERT FOR SYMPTOMS CONSISTENT WITH COVID-19.  CDC
DEFINES FEVER AS TEMPERATURE GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 100.4 F (38C) DEGREES.
INDIVIDUALS THAT DEVELOP FEVER, COUGH, OR BREATHING DIFFICULTY OR RECENT
LOSS OF TASTE OR SMELL SHOULD IMMEDIATELY SELF-ISOLATE, LIMIT CONTACT WITH
OTHERS, AND SEEK ADVICE BY TELEPHONE FROM A HEALTHCARE PROVIDER TO DETERMINE
IF FURTHER MEDICAL EVALUATION IS REQUIRED.

2.G. RESTRICTION OF MOVEMENT (ROM).  GENERAL DOD TERM FOR LIMITING PERSONAL
INTERACTION TO REDUCE RISK TO THE HEALTH, SAFETY AND WELFARE OF A BROADER
COHORT.  ROM IS USED TO MINIMIZE RISK OF INDIVIDUALS ENCOUNTERING COVID-19
CONTAGIOUS INDIVIDUALS, AND TO PREVENT PERSONNEL WHO HAVE BEEN IN A HIGHER
RISK AREA FROM POTENTIALLY INFECTING OTHERS. ROM INCLUDES ISOLATION,
QUARANTINE AND ROM-SEQUESTER.

2.G.1. ISOLATION: MEDICAL TERM FOR THE STRICT SEPARATION OF PERSONNEL FROM
OTHERS DUE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF POTENTIAL COVID-19 SYMPTOMS OR A POSITIVE
COVID-19 TEST.

2.G.2. QUARANTINE: MEDICAL TERM FOR SEPARATING ASYMPTOMATIC PERSONNEL FROM
THOSE PEOPLE REASONABLY BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO A COMMUNICABLE
DISEASE, TO PREVENT THE POSSIBLE SPREAD OF THE COMMUNICABLE DISEASE.  FOR
THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, PERSONNEL WITH NO COVID-19 SYMPTOMS WHO HAVE RECENTLY
RETURNED FROM A HIGHER RISK LOCATION OR HAD CLOSE CONTACT WITH A KNOWN
COVID-19 POSITIVE PATIENT SHOULD BE QUARANTINED. THE QUARANTINE PERIOD IS
14 DAYS.

2.G.3. ROM-SEQUESTER: U.S. NAVY TERM FOR PREEMPTIVE SEPARATION OF FORCES TO
REDUCE RISK OF INFECTION WHILE ESTABLISHING A COVID-FREE BUBBLE.
ROM-SEQUESTER CAN BE CONDUCTED ONBOARD SHIP, IN CONTRACTED FACILITIES, OR IN
PERSONAL RESIDENCE DEPENDENT ON UNIT-SPECIFIC SCENARIOS.  DURING
ROM-SEQUESTER, INTERACTION WITH INDIVIDUALS TRAVELING OUTSIDE OF THE ROM-SEQUESTER LOCATION MUST BE MINIMIZED.  INTERACTION WITHIN ROM-SEQUESTER LOCATION IS RESTRICTED
TO BASIC NECESSITIES SUCH AS FOOD DELIVERY.

2.H. BUBBLE.  U.S. NAVY TERM FOR INDIVIDUALS, UNITS OR INSTALLATIONS THAT
HAVE ESTABLISHED LOW PROBABILITY OF COVID-19 INFECTION. A CREW THAT HAS BEEN
UNDERWAY, OR ROM-SEQUESTERED AT THE PIER, FOR GREATER THAN 14 DAYS WITHOUT
COVID-19 POSITIVE PERSONNEL AND NO COVID-19 SYMPTOMS IS WITHIN A BUBBLE.

2.I. BUBBLE TO BUBBLE TRANSFER (B2BT). U.S. NAVY TERM FOR MOVEMENT OF UNITS
OR PERSONNEL FROM ONE BUBBLE TO ANOTHER VIA CONTROLLED MEANS.  A WIDE
VARIETY OF MODES/MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION CAN BE USED FOR B2BT.  THE KEY FACTOR IS
THAT THE EVOLUTION IS CLOSELY CONTROLLED TO MINIMIZE RISK OF COVID-19
EXPOSURE TO BOTH INDIVIDUALS AND UNITS DURING TRANSFER.

3. MINIMUM ACTION REQUIRED PRIOR TO DEPLOYED OPERATIONS.

3.A. MANDATORY MEDICAL SCREENING BY A MEDICAL PROVIDER.

3.A.1. PRE-DEPLOYMENT SCREENING FOR ALL PERSONNEL WILL CONSIST OF AN
ASSESSMENT OF COVID-19 EXPOSURE HISTORY, A TEMPERATURE CHECK, A CHECK FOR
COVID-19 SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS LISTED IN PARA 2.E.FOR MILITARY MEMBERS, IT WILL
ALSO INCLUDE A REVIEW OF ANY PAST COVID-19 TESTING AND A THOROUGH EVALUATION
OF THE MEMBERS HIGH RISK FACTORS.

3.A.2. DEPLOYMENT WITH HIGH RISK INDIVIDUALS SHOULD BE RARE.  DECISIONS MUST
BE MADE, AT A MINIMUM, BY THE ISIC.  MILITARY SEALIFT COMMAND WILL MEDICALLY
SCREEN CIVIL SERVICE AND CONTRACT PERSONNEL FOR DEPLOYMENT ON MSC VESSELS IN
ACCORDANCE WITH EXISTING MSC INSTRUCTIONS AND CONTRACTS.

3.B. CONDUCT A MINIMUM 14-DAY ROM-SEQUESTER PRIOR TO DEPLOYMENT. DEPENDING
ON SCHEDULE AND PLANNED OPERATIONS, THE NCC WILL DETERMINE IF ROM-SEQUESTER IS
WARRANTED PRIOR TO INTEGRATED PHASE.

3.B.1. CONDUCT ENHANCED DAILY PERSONNEL MEDICAL SCREENING (QUESTIONNAIRE/
TEMPERATURE CHECKS).

3.B.2. ALL PERSONNEL DEPLOYING OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WILL UNDERGO A
14-DAY ROM-SEQUESTER PRIOR TO DEPLOYMENT.  IF TRAVELING OCONUS AND THE HOST NATION
REQUIRES 14-DAY IN-COUNTRY ROM, CONUS PRE-DEPLOYMENT ROM-SEQUESTER IS NOT
REQUIRED UNLESS THE HOST NATION EXPLICITLY MANDATES BOTH.

3.B.3. ACCEPTABLE ROM-SEQUESTER FACILITIES ARE:  SHIP BERTHING, LIVING BARGE,
INDIVIDUAL BARRACKS/HOTEL ROOMS, OR PERSONAL RESIDENCE (WITH LIMITED CONTACT
WITH OTHER RESIDENTS).  EACH HAS PROS AND CONS THAT MUST BE WEIGHED AGAINST
UNIT-SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES AND RISK.  MINIMIZING CONTACT WITH OTHERS AND
FOLLOWING PUBLIC HEALTH MITIGATION MEASURES IS CRITICAL TO SUCCESSFUL
ROM-SEQUESTER.

3.B.4. PRACTICE PHYSICAL DISTANCING AND SANITIZE MORE FREQUENTLY WHILE
MANNING ESSENTIAL WATCH STATIONS, COMPLETING REQUIRED MAINTENANCE, AND
CONDUCTING REQUIRED UNDERWAY PREPARATION (LOGISTICS, TRAINING, ETC.).

3.B.5. DEVELOP OPERATIONAL BENCH FOR REDLINE PERSONNEL TO MAINTAIN MISSION
ESSENTIAL OPERATIONS (NUCLEAR POWER PLANT, BRIDGE, COMBAT INFORMATION
CENTER, CWC WATCHES, MEDICAL PROVIDERS, ETC.).

3.C. DEPLOYING UNITS WILL TEST/ROM-SEQUESTER PER FLEET APPROVED COMMUNITY
CONOPS. THESE CONOPS WERE REVIEWED BY BUMED FOR THE LATEST SCIENTIFIC
EFFICACY AND SHOULD BE FOLLOWED TO ENSURE STANDARDIZATION AND CONSISTENCY
ACROSS THE FORCE.  TESTING IS THE BEST WAY TO IDENTIFY ASYMPTOMATIC COVID-19
POSITIVE INDIVIDUALS.  HOWEVER, TESTING DOES NOT GUARANTEE A COVID-FREE
DEPLOYING UNIT DUE TO THE POTENTIAL FOR FALSE NEGATIVE TESTS. USE
OPERATIONAL UNIT RETURN TO WORK (RTW) GUIDANCE, PARA. 7.D.1. TO CLEAR COVID POSITIVE
TESTS.

3.D. SHIP RIDERS (E.G., CONTRACTORS, TECH REPS, INSPECTION TEAMS, ETC.),
DIRECT SUPPORT PERSONNEL, AND ALL OTHERS ASSISTING COMMANDS PRIOR TO BUBBLE
ESTABLISHMENT WILL ADHERE TO LOCAL FORCE HEALTH PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS
(DAILY COVID-19 SCREENING QUESTIONNAIRE, TEMPERATURE CHECKS, PHYSICAL
DISTANCING, PPE, RESTRICTED SHIPBOARD MOVEMENT, SANITIZATION, ETC.).  WHEN
INVOLVED IN MOVEMENT TO SEQUENTIAL COMMANDS, IT MAY BE ADVISABLE TO
ROM-SEQUESTER TEAMS, USE B2BT, AND/OR TEST PERIODICALLY.

3.E. SHIP RIDERS (E.G., CONTRACTORS, TECH REPS, INSPECTION TEAMS, ETC.),
DIRECT SUPPORT PERSONNEL, AND ALL OTHERS PENETRATING AN ESTABLISHED BUBBLE
WILL COMPLETE A 14-DAY ROM-SEQUESTER PRIOR TO EMBARKING. USE OPERATIONAL
UNIT RTW GUIDANCE TO CLEAR COVID POSITIVE TESTS, PARA. 7.D.1.  MITIGATION PLANS
TO PENETRATE AN ESTABLISHED BUBBLE WITHOUT A 14 DAY ROM-SEQUESTER DUE TO
EMERGENT OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS MUST BE APPROVED BY THE NCC.

4. MINIMUM REQUIRED ACTION FOR MAINTENANCE, BASIC, ADVANCED/INTEGRATED, AND
SUSTAINMENT PHASES.

4.A. MAINTENANCE PHASE.  AGGRESSIVE AWARENESS, DIAGNOSIS, AND CONTACT
TRACING ARE CRITICAL TO COMBAT COVID-19. COMMANDERS MUST REMAIN ALERT TO THE REALITY
SOME SAILORS CARRYING COVID-19 MAY BE ASYMPTOMATIC AND MITIGATE RISKS
ACCORDINGLY. THE FOLLOWING MINIMUM MEASURES APPLY:

4.A.1. FOLLOW LOCAL HPCON STATUS AND FHP MEASURES.  EMPHASIZE PERSONAL
RESPONSIBILITY (CLOTH FACE COVERINGS, PHYSICAL DISTANCING, AVOID LOCAL AREAS
WITH HIGH POPULATION DENSITY, SELF-MONITOR, ETC.).  REPORT AND ISOLATE
PERSONNEL WITH COVID-19 SYMPTOMS. SCREEN ALL PERSONNEL AND VISITORS DAILY AT
WORK, TO INCLUDE TEMPERATURE CHECKS.  CLEAN AND DISINFECT SPACES DAILY IAW
NAVSEA CLEANING GUIDANCE.  CONSIDER ADDITIONAL COVID-19 ORM MEASURES FOR
MAJOR EVENTS (E.G., SHIPBOARD DRILLS).

4.A.2. SUPPORT ORGANIZATION COMMANDERS (E.G., SHIPYARD PERSONNEL, CONTRACT
SUPPORT, TRAINING TEAMS, ETC.) SHOULD CONSIDER CURRENT HPCON, CDC THREAT
LEVEL, METHOD/MODE OF TRAVEL, ETC. WHEN ASSESSING RISK AND DETERMINING IF
ROM-SEQUESTER IS WARRANTED.  FOR EXAMPLE, A TEAM OF SHIPYARD WORKERS MOVING
FROM AN AREA WITH LOW COVID CASES TO AN AREA OF LOW, MEDIUM OR HIGH COVID
CASES MIGHT NOT WARRANT ROM-SEQUESTER UNLESS COMPELLED BY OTHER
CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS TRAVEL THROUGH A HIGH RISK AIRPORT.  REGARDLESS, VISITORS SHOULD
FOLLOW THE SAME DAILY SCREENING PROCEDURES, SELF-MONITORING, TEMPERATURE
CHECKS, PHYSICAL DISTANCING, PPE, AND PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY PROTOCOLS AS
SHIPS FORCE.

4.A.3 AIRCRAFT SQUADRON COMMANDERS SHOULD CONSIDER THE CURRENT RISK LEVEL
PER PARAGRAPH 4.A.2 TO DETERMINE IF ROM-SEQUESTER IS REQUIRED FOR TRAINING
DETACHMENTS.  FOR EXAMPLE, A SAILOR MAY USE A PERSONAL VEHICLE TO DRIVE FROM
MILITARY BASE TO MILITARY BASE WITH INFREQUENT GAS OR FOOD STOPS TO MAINTAIN
A MODIFIED BUBBLE.  REGARDLESS, TRAVELERS SHOULD FOLLOW THE SAME DAILY
SCREENING PROCEDURES, SELF-MONITORING, TEMPERATURE CHECKS, PHYSICAL
DISTANCING, PPE, AND PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY PROTOCOLS DICTATED BY LOCAL
HPCON CONDITIONS.

4.B. BASIC PHASE.  INCLUDES SAME MEASURES AS THE MAINTENANCE PHASE, PLUS:

4.B.1. UNDERWAY OPERATIONS WITH ABILITY TO GET MEDICAL TREATMENT FACILITY
(MTF) SUPPORT WITHIN 72 HOURS.  SCREEN HIGH RISK SAILORS AND ENSURE PPE
LOADOUT MEETS FLEET GUIDANCE.  FOLLOW PLATFORM SPECIFIC COVID-19 CONOPS AND
SOPS.

4.B.2. UNDERWAY OPERATIONS WHEN MTF SUPPORT WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE WITHIN
72 HOURS.  SAME MEASURES AS LOCAL OPERATIONS, PLUS, IAW FLEET COMMANDER
GUIDANCE, CONSIDER MEDICAL TEAM AUGMENT, MEDEVAC AUGMENT/HELO CAPABILITY,
AND SHIPBOARD TESTING CAPABILITY.

4.C. ADVANCED AND INTEGRATED PHASES. SAME MEASURES AS MAINTENANCE AND BASIC
PHASES, PLUS:

4.C.1. IF DEPLOYING IMMEDIATELY AFTER INTEGRATED PHASE (I.E., COMPTUEX(C2X))
OR PRE-OVERSEAS MOVEMENT EVALUATION (POMEVAL), FOLLOW GUIDANCE IN PARAGRAPH 3.

4.D. SUSTAINMENT PHASE.

4.D.1. UNDERWAY:  MAINTAIN BUBBLE PER PARAGRAPH 3.E.

4.D.2. PIER-SIDE: FOLLOWING DEPLOYMENT, FOLLOW BASIC PHASE GUIDANCE.
OPERATIONAL COMMANDERS MAY ELECT TO SHIFT TO PARAGRAPH 3 GUIDANCE DEPENDING
ON LIKELIHOOD OF CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS.

4.E. FOR SHORE BASED COMMANDS SENDING PERSONNEL TO AFLOAT UNITS, FOLLOW THE
GUIDANCE THAT APPLIES TO THE PHASE OF THE RECEIVING UNIT.  FOR ALL PERSONNEL
TRAVELING TO SHORE COMMANDS (E.G., SCHOOLS, TDY, ETC.), FOLLOW MAINTENANCE
PHASE CRITERIA OF PARA 4.A.

4.F. FOR ALL PHASES, DISCIPLINED INDIVIDUAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH
PROTECTION MEASURES ARE THE BEDROCK OF RISK REDUCTION AND RISK MITIGATION.
COVID MITIGATION PROTOCOL, WHERE APPROPRIATE, SHOULD CONSIDER ADDITIONAL
SUPPORT FOR HIGH RISK PERSONNEL.  COMMANDERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING,
MANAGING, OVERSEEING AND IMPLEMENTING PROTOCOLS FOR THEIR UNITS. INDIVIDUALS
ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR EXECUTING THOSE PROTOCOLS.

5. DUE TO THE UNIQUE NATURE OF FORWARD DEPLOYED NAVAL FORCES (FDNF) AND
THEIR HOST NATION RELATIONSHIP, NCCS WILL DEFINE OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR FDNF
UNITS USING SECTIONS 3 AND 4 AS THE BASIS.

6. COMMANDERS MAY NEED TO EXEMPT AIRCREW AND AIRCRAFT MAINTAINERS FROM THIS
GUIDANCE TO MEET EMERGENT OPERATIONAL OR NATOPS CURRENCY REQUIREMENTS.
ROBUST RISK MITIGATION IS REQUIRED TO MINIMIZE COVID THREATS TO EXISTING BUBBLES.
MITIGATION PLANS MUST BE APPROVED BY THE NCC.

7. REQUIRED ACTION WHEN MILITARY, CIVILIAN, OR CONTRACTOR EXHIBITS SIGNS OR
SYMPTOMS OF COVID-19 INFECTION.

7.A. ISOLATE, MEDICALLY SCREEN AND DESIGNATE AS PUI. RESTRICT CONTACT AND
PROTECT THE OPERATIONAL BENCH IF APPLICABLE.

7.A.1. IF ISOLATED ABOARD SHIP, USE SMALL BERTHING AREAS (E.G., STATEROOMS,
PREFERABLY WITH HEADS) FOR SEPARATION.  WHEN ADEQUATE SHIPBOARD ISOLATION
CAPACITY IS EXHAUSTED, CONSIDER TRANSFERRING PUIS TO UNITS WITH REMAINING
CAPACITY OR ASHORE, IF FEASIBLE AND MISSION ALLOWS.

7.A.2. IF ISOLATED ASHORE, PROVIDE NECESSARY MEDICAL TREATMENT UNTIL
CLINICALLY IMPROVED.

7.B. IDENTIFY, QUARANTINE, AND MEDICALLY SCREEN CLOSE CONTACTS OF COVID-19
CASES AND SYMPTOMATIC PUIS AS DEFINED IN PARAGRAPHS 2.A AND 2.B.  MINIMUM
SCREENING SHOULD INCLUDE COVID-19 QUESTIONNAIRE TO ASSESS RISK TO EXPOSURE,
TEMPERATURE CHECK, AND VISUAL CHECK FOR SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OUTLINED BY THE
CDC.  WHEN ADEQUATE SHIPBOARD QUARANTINE CAPACITY IS EXHAUSTED, CONSIDER
TRANSFERRING CLOSE CONTACTS TO UNITS WITH REMAINING CAPACITY OR ASHORE, IF
FEASIBLE AND MISSION ALLOWS.

7.B.1. QUARANTINE CLOSE CONTACTS FOR 14 DAYS.  AFTER 14 DAYS, IF ASYMPTOMATIC,
RELEASE FROM QUARANTINE.

7.B.2.  PER PARAGRAPH 2.B., ASYMPTOMATIC INDIVIDUALS QUARANTINED DUE TO
CLOSE CONTACT ARE NOT CONSIDERED PUI.

7.B.3. IF CLOSE CONTACT BECOMES SYMPTOMATIC - FOLLOW PUI PROTOCOL.

7.C. PROTOCOL FOR PUI.

7.C.1 TEST PUI IF POSSIBLE.

7.C.2. IF TEST RESULT POSITIVE - CONTINUE ISOLATION AND TREAT.

7.C.3 IF TEST RESULT NEGATIVE - PROVIDE MEDICAL TREATMENT UNTIL CLINICALLY
IMPROVED.

7.C.4 IF TEST RESULT NEGATIVE AND PUI DOES NOT IMPROVE - ISOLATE AND FOLLOW
PARAGRAPH 7.D.

7.C.5 IF NO TEST PERFORMED - MEDICALLY SCREEN TWICE A DAY AT A MINIMUM AND,
IF SYMPTOMS WORSEN, CONSULT MEDICAL AUTHORITIES REGARDING TRANSFER TO
MEDICAL TREATMENT FACILITY.

7.D. RETURN TO WORK GUIDANCE FOR COVID-19 CASES.

7.D.1. OPERATIONAL UNITS.  COVID-19 CASES MUST MEET ALL OF THE FOLLOWING
CRITERIA TO RETURN TO WORK:  (1) AT LEAST 72 HOURS HAVE PASSED SINCE RECOVERY

RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS (E.G., COUGH, SHORTNESS OF BREATH), AND (3) NEGATIVE
PCR TEST RESULTS FROM AT LEAST TWO CONSECUTIVE RESPIRATORY SPECIMENS COLLECTED
MORE THAN OR EQUAL TO 24 HOURS APART.

7.D.3 NCC MAY ELECT TO TREAT CRITICAL OPERATIONAL ENABLERS, SUCH AS INSPECTION
AND CERTIFICATION TEAMS, AS OPERATIONAL UNITS, PARA. 7.D.1.

7.E. PERSONNEL MAY CONTINUE TO TEST POSITIVE DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF
PERSISTENT NON-INFECTIOUS VIRAL FRAGMENTS.  THEREFORE, UNITS MAY ELECT TO USE
PARA. 7.D.2.A TO SAFELY RTW.  INDIVIDUALS THAT EXHIBIT NEW OR PERSISTENT
SYMPTOMS SHOULD BE EVALUATED BY A MEDICAL PROVIDER AND PLACED/KEPT IN
ISOLATION UNTIL SYMPTOMS RESOLVE.

7.F. VIRAL CULTURE: VIRAL CULTURE SHOULD NOT BE USED AS A PRIMARY OR
STAND-ALONE RETURN TO WORK CRITERIA. HOWEVER, IF A VIRAL CULTURE HAS BEEN
OBTAINED DURING A COVID CASE CLINICAL EVALUATION, RESULTS MAY BE USED AS
SUPPLEMENTAL CRITERIA FOR PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING CASES.

8. POST-DEPLOYMENT/REDEPLOYMENT.

8.A. MILITARY MEMBERS RETURNING TO CONUS FROM DEPLOYMENT WILL COMPLETE A
14-DAY ROM AT HOME STATION.  MEMBERS RETURNING VIA SHIP OR MILAIR WITH NO ACTIVE
COVID-19 CASES WITHIN THEIR UNIT IN THE LAST 14 DAYS, MAY COUNT TRANSIT TIME
(BEGINNING ON THE DAY OF DEPARTURE FROM THE LAST PORT OR AIRFIELD) TOWARD
THE ROM REQUIREMENT.  SERVICE MEMBERS ON POST-DEPLOYMENT ROM ARE RESTRICTED TO
THEIR PERSONAL RESIDENCE OR OTHER APPROPRIATE DOMICILE AND MUST LIMIT CLOSE
CONTACT.

8.B. REDEPLOYING INDIVIDUALS MUST BE SCREENED AT THE ASSIGNED PLACE OF DUTY
