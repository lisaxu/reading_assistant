DoD COVID-19 PRACTICE MANAGEMENT GUIDE
Clinical Management of COVID-19
  This Practice Management Guide does not supersede DoD Policy.
It is based upon the best information available at the time of publication. It is designed to provide information and assist decision making. It is not intended to define a standard of care and should not be construed as one. Neither should it be interpreted as prescribing an exclusive course of management. It was developed by experts in this field. Variations in practice will inevitably and appropriately occur when clinicians take into account the needs of individual patients, available resources, and limitations unique to an institution or type of practice. Every healthcare professional making use of this guideline is responsible for evaluating the appropriateness of applying it in the setting of any particular clinical situation. The Practice Management Guide is not intended to represent TRICARE policy. Further, inclusion of recommendations for specific testing and/or therapeutic interventions within this guide does not guarantee coverage of civilian sector care.

DoD COVID-19 Practice Management Guide v3.0 Summary of Changes
New Sections:
 Outpatient Management (replaced Treatment of Mild Infections)
 Removed Oxygen Therapy and Monitoring and combined it with the ARDS Section
 Rehabilitation Section
 Telemedicine Section put back in
 Public Health Section
 Ethics Section is back, but shorter
Updated throughout with new literature, studies, and society guidelines across disciplines Major Updates and Changes by Section:
Planning & Preparation: paragraph on “returning to the new normal”
Infection Prevention & Control: updated with new CDC guidance. Emory visuals on PPE removed from the Appendices and included as a link. New Appendices for this section.
Collection of Specimens: updated with IDSA recommendations from late April advising against use of serologic testing for patient screening due to high false positive rate. Two negative tests are no longer recommended by the CDC to document clearance of infection in hospitalized patients.
Co-infections Section: mentions risk of Aspergillus
ARDS Section: more liberal criteria for intubation; no longer recommending early intubation, but using criteria of progressive hypoxia, worsening chest infiltrates, hypercarbia, decreased mental status, or worsening dyspnea. Added section on Extubation, including an Extubation protocol in the Appendices. Discussed hypothesis of two types of COVID-19 ARDS: Light “L” type and heavy “H” type with the potential for different management strategies for PEEP based on physiologic differences. This is not an evidence-based discussion, but merely a hypothesis mentioned for completeness.
Prevention of Complications: Hematology section is completely rewritten
Code Blue: updated to reflect newly released AHA guidelines with ACLS/PALS algorithms included in the Appendices. Focus is on protecting healthcare personnel (HCP).
Imaging: Includes Fleischner Society recommendations for chest imaging (CXR, CT). Also discusses increased risk of thromboembolic complications and related imaging to address this.
Adjunctive Therapies: Updated with new data, literature and includes a summary statement

at the top of the section regarding the need for RCT results and that there is no data to support use outside of a clinical trial. Remdesivir preliminary results from SIMPLE and ACTT trials included, although these are not published or peer-reviewed at this time. The FDA cautions use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine outside of a clinical trial due to the risk of heart problems associated with these medications. Convalescent plasma is moving through approval for DoD FHP IND, although there is not yet data from controlled trials to suggest benefit.
Special Populations: Several updates to the Pregnancy section, including new guidance on ultrasound cleaning in the Appendix and the section is now organized by stage of labor with a new table on common OB medications. The neonatal and pediatric sections were updated to reflect new AAP guidance. The Pediatric section has several changes, including movement of all pediatric-related topics to this section. It also discusses new reports of children presenting with a multisystem inflammatory syndrome similar to Kawasaki disease, toxic shock syndrome, and myocarditis. Peds ID dosing recommendations were also included for some of the adjunctive therapies.
Surgical Implications: Significant updates to reflect new publications from multiple societies. Operational: Significant updates, including new TRANSCOM guidance for transport.
Behavioral Health: Changed from Mental Health with several updates throughout the section.
En Route Critical Care: Completely updated.
Facilities: Now includes discussion on HEPA filters and UV (bullets 6-9 are new).

Clinical Management of COVID-19
 BACKGROUND
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). COVID- 19 was first described in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and is now a global pandemic. Most of those affected have milder illness (80%), 15% will be severely ill (most often some degree of hypoxemic respiratory failure) and 5% will require critical care interventions.(1) Of those who are critically ill, most require early intubation and mechanical ventilation. Other complications include septic shock and multi-organ failure, including acute kidney injury and cardiac injury.(2) Older age and comorbid conditions, including hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease increase risk of death.(3-5) The virus is highly contagious and spread via respiratory droplets, direct contact, and if aerosolized, airborne routes.
The intent of this publication is to provide clinicians and military medical treatment facilities (MTFs) with best practices based on latest evidence to optimize DoD response to the current COVID-19 pandemic.
CLINICAL PRESENTATION & CLINICAL COURSE
1. Incubation period: ~4-5 days (interquartile range: 2 to 7 days).(6, 7) Some studies have estimated a wider range for the incubation period; data for human infection with other coronaviruses (e.g. MERS-CoV, SARS- CoV) suggest that the incubation period may range from 2-14 days; a study of 181 COVID-19 patients supported these initial estimates and found that 97.5% of symptomatic patients develop symptoms within 11.5 days of infection.(8)
2. Frequently reported symptoms of patients admitted to the hospital: (3, 9-14)
• Fever (77–98%)
• Cough (46%–82%)
• Myalgia or fatigue (11–52%)
• Shortness of breath (SOB) (3-31%)
• GI symptoms, e.g., anorexia, diarrhea, nausea (pooled prevalence 17.6% in meta-analysis of 60
studies, may precede respiratory symptoms)
• Anosmia, hyposmia, or dysgeusia (30-88%)
3. Among 1,099 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, fever was present in 44% at hospital admission, and developed in 89% during hospitalization.(7)
4. Less commonly reported symptoms: sore throat, headache, cough with sputum production and/or hemoptysis, and lower respiratory tract signs and symptoms.(3, 4, 7)
5. Risk factors for severe illness are not yet clear, although older patients and those with chronic medical conditions may be at higher risk for severe illness.(3, 15)
6. Pregnant women: Based on limited data, pregnant women do not appear to be at higher risk for severe disease. Emerging reports from the United States suggest that pregnant women may be at higher risk of atypical presentation with severe disease and caesarean delivery. Additionally, women who develop pneumonia appear to have increased risk of preterm labor.(16-20)
7. Children: Limited information is available about the clinical presentation, clinical course, and risk factors for severe COVID-19 in children with approximately 5-6% presenting with severe illness. In China, COVID-19 made up between 1.5-2% of acute respiratory admissions, with a median age of 7 years. In the US, the median age reported thus far was 11 years. Along with the typical symptoms described, emesis and diarrhea appear to be prominent with the virus found in stool samples suggesting fecal-oral transmission. Critically ill children have presented with ARDS, septic shock, encephalopathy and myocarditis. Co-infections with other respiratory viruses or bacteria are common. The MMWR study reported that hospitalized children were more commonly <1 yr and had underlying conditions, e.g., asthma.(6, 21-27)
8. Prolonged detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been reported and appears to be related to severity of illness; in respiratory specimens (up to 6 weeks) and stool specimens (>30 days).(21, 22, 28)
9. Clinical presentation among cases of COVID-19 varies in severity from asymptomatic to fatal illness. Several reports suggest clinical deterioration can occur during the 2nd week of illness (range: 5 – 13 days).(3, 11)

Clinical Management of COVID-19
10. Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure developed in 17–29% of hospitalized patients. Secondary infection developed in 10%, with a median time from symptom onset to of respiratory failure of 8 days.(3, 9, 10)
11. Approximately 20-30% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia have required critical care. Compared to patients not admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), critically ill patients were older (median age 66 years vs. 51 years), and were more likely to have underlying co-morbid conditions (72% vs 37%).(3, 10)
12. Among critically ill patients admitted to an ICU, 11–64% received high-flow oxygen therapy and 47-71% received mechanical ventilation. A small proportion (3-12% of ICU patients) have also been supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).(9, 10, 15)
13. Other reported complications include cardiac injury, sudden cardiac death, arrhythmia, septic shock, liver dysfunction, acute kidney injury, venous and arterial thrombosis despite chemoprophylaxis, and multi- organ failure.(29) A Dutch review of COVID-19 positive patients admitted to an ICU the pneumonia revealed 31% had a thrombotic complication with the majority of these being pulmonary emboli.(30) Viral inclusion bodies have been seen in endothelium of kidneys, small bowel, and heart suggesting that endotheliopathy could be contributing to thrombotic complications.(31)
14. Case fatality rates (CFR) appear to vary by location and related to demographics, e.g., median age, of the population. A CFR of 2.3% has been reported among confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China.(15) However, the majority of these cases were hospitalized patients, so this mortality estimate is likely biased upward. Among hospitalized patients with pneumonia, the case fatality proportion has been reported as 4–15%.(3, 9, 10) In a report from one Chinese hospital, 61.5% of critically ill patients with COVID-19 had died by day 28 of ICU admission. Among all critically ill COVID-19 patients in China, the reported case fatality proportion was 49%.(2)
15. As of 11 May 20, the Italian government COVID-19 surveillance group reported 28,903 deaths associated with COVID-19, of which 84.8% >70 yr, 10.5% 60-69 yr, 3.6% 50-59 yr, 0.9% 40-49 yr, 0.2% 30-39 yr, 0.04% <30 yr. Of the 2,621 patients for whom data on pre-existing co-morbidities are available, approximately 60% had >3 pre-existing co-morbidities (e.g., hypertension, type 2 diabetes, ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation). The CFR for Italy was estimated at 13.2%. https://www.epicentro.iss.it/en/coronavirus/
16. In the US, as of 11 May 20, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports 79,756 COVID-19- related deaths. (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) CFR increases with age (highest in ≥85 yr). As of 2 May, the overall cumulative hospitalization rate is 50.3 per 100,000, with highest rates in people ≥65 yr (162.2 per 100,000) and 50-64 yr (79.0 per 100,000).

Clinical Management of COVID-19
 PLANNING AND PREPARATION
Facility Incident Command and Systems.
1. A local emergency response command structure with clearly defined roles and lines of communication should be defined.(32, 33) These structures should have the ability to coordinate expansion or restriction of resources in conjunction with unit medical directors, help coordinate “just in time” training as well as regional expert consultation (i.e. tele-consultation with critical care, infectious disease, or other specialists), facilitate the flow of staff, critical equipment and patients, and coordinate with Contingency the Crisis Standard of Care (CSC) changes on both a local and regional level. Additionally, the local Incident Command Center (ICC) should liaise and coordinate with the community as transition through crisis care levels and resource triage if needed, depends on regional, not just local, healthcare utilization.
2. Establish and Manage Crisis/Contingency Standards of Care
a. Crisis Standards of Care are “a substantial change in usual healthcare operations and the level of care it is
possible to deliver, which is made necessary by a pervasive (e.g., pandemic influenza) or catastrophic (e.g.,
earthquake, hurricane) disaster.”(34)
b. The establishment of CSC should enable specific legal and regulatory protections for health care providers.
For reference, DODI 6200.03 allows for establishment of a CSC within the DoD.
c. Design and implementation of these standards for each agency should remain flexible based on each
situation and should be tiered (i.e. normal operations, contingency, crisis) and have specific triggers to
engage. In general Contingency when >120% typical capacity and Crisis when >200% capacity.
d. Contingency Care is more similar to typical care standards with most staff working in their usual
environments but with expanded clinical responsibilities.
e. Crisis Standards of Care, if invoked, triggers significantly altered staffing models as described below with
incumbent assumed risks of increased morbidity and mortality. CSC should be developed by multi- disciplinary groups and collated by the Incident Command Center (ICC) and should be individualized to a facility. A list of topics that should be included:
• Authority and triggers for enacting escalating from usual to Contingency then Crisis
• Just in time training & scope of practice changes as CSC escalate (nursing, physician, etc)
• Alterations in practice allowed (limiting documentation, changes in work hours and locations,
changes in location of patient care and monitoring requirements).
• Alternations from normal should be limited as much as possible to mitigate patient safety risks.
3. Establish clear lines of communication (LOC) to ensure:
a. The ability to communicate updated processes and protocols.
b. The ability to transfer clinical information with patients through the system.
c. That communication be consistent, from designated sources, and information be trusted by staff.(35-37)
4. Establish Patient Tracking and Re-unification systems: Plan and coordinate a system for patient tracking, identification, and the ability to communicate with next of kin who may be restricted from visitation.(37)
5. Establish security, access points, and “clean” areas with access restricted:
a. Security should be included in the planning process given increased community stress and security risks
during the COVID-19 pandemic.
b. Establish “satellite” units in alternative locations to care for patients unaffected by the pandemic to protect
non-infected patients and high-risk staff (e.g., underlying medical conditions, age >60).(38)
c. Consider access to specialty or routine care that may be needed in these areas with screening as patients
enter.
d. Establish single or controlled points of entry for every facility and initiate screening procedures for
possibly infected patients at entrances.
6. Coordination of re-prioritization of clinical duties:
a. Focus on urgent care, but ensure a process for providing necessary routine care when unsafe to defer.
b. Care should be primarily virtual unless a face-to-face visit is necessary as determined by the care team.
c. Closely track access and demand and consider expanding or contracting services based on local
epidemiology and need.
 Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 6

Clinical Management of COVID-19
d. Coordinate re-allocation of assets off loaded by limitations to areas of need (Critical Care, Inpatient care, Initial triage, and Urgent/Emergency Care).(39)
e. Limit administrative, educational and academic duties to those necessary to directly support patient care.
f. Frequently message patients and staff any changes in services, clinic hours, entry procedures, etc. to
manage their expectations.
Figure 2. A framework outlining the conventional, contingency, and crisis surge responses. PACU: post-anesthesia care unit. [from Christian, et al.; Chest (2014)].(40)
7. Develop Recall Roster for all assets (nursing, physician, housekeeping, dietary, security, admin, etc) and triggers for re-calling those who may be needed from remote work.
8. Consider logistic/ancillary support needs when determining “Essential Personnel” for tasks including:
a. Disposal of personal protective equipment (PPE) and cleaning both “dirty” rooms and shared spaces.
These tasks should be prioritized and will be in very high demand.(41)
b. Allocation of adequate space for safe, respectful care of the deceased.(42)
c. Designating locations and facilities to shelter and feed families of ill patients, staff members, and even
families of staff members to augment and limit the up to 40-50% absenteeism anticipated with illness, school/childcare closure, and fear.(38, 39)
Preparing Critical Care Resources & Teams.
1. Understand the following steps provide a framework and are not the “correct” way to manage bed or staffing expansion. Exact staffing models, ratios, logistic and system support models should reflect the needs of the community and resources available at local centers. Transitioning to Crisis Care models carries with it significant increases in both morbidity and mortality above that seen in standard care models. It should be undertaken only when absolutely necessary, with careful consideration, and in an iterative way assessing for increased volume paradoxically leading to excessively increased morbidity and mortality.
2. Staffing. In a global pandemic causing a surge of emergency room and admitted patients, additional staffing models should be considered. Although telehealth resources should be optimized, there may still be significant deficits in critical care trained healthcare workers.
 Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 7

Clinical Management of COVID-19
a. Staff Shortages:
i. Illness, fatigue, fear, and care giver duties, particularly with school/daycare closure, limit staff
availability with some estimates as high as 40-60% absenteeism.(38, 43)
ii. Augmenting staffing initially with increased “mandated overtime” should be avoided as long as
possible to avoid early staff burn out.
iii. Facility based alteration of staffing ratios (i.e. less provider staff in the inpatient setting overnight)
may help reduce staff burden while maintaining reasonable coverage in keeping with typical
hospital processes.
iv. Strategies listed above may mitigate (facility based child care, cohort care teams, etc.) but
planning should consider at least a 25-40% reduction in staff availability. Additional recommendations to augment staff availability include:(44)
 A PPE officer (can be trained non-clinical staff) to train and monitor PPE and staff exposure on each ward
 Mental health support or “resiliency teams” with focus on staff wellness and support
 Team “Safety officers” to monitor/ensure breaks, hydration, toileting and nutrition
v. Critical Care. The Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) recommends staffing models to
support expanded critical care bed capacity in the event of a global pandemic, which includes use of multiple non-ICU trained healthcare workers. Those staff noted below should be ICU trained and experienced and include: (45)
 Critical Care Physician
 Respiratory Therapist
 Advanced Practice Providers (APP)
 Critical Care Nurse (CCRN or experienced active RN working in critical care)
 In facilities without intensivists,
 Staffing for the roles could include but are not limited to those with some previous critical care training or experience and could include:
o Non-ICU physician:
o CRNA, CAA, MD/DO: Residents from medical or surgical specialties (with appropriate supervision and graduated responsibility) or other medical or surgical staff preferably with experience in inpatient medicine
o Non-ICU nurse tiered from best to least suited:(44)
1. RN currently working in progressive care units (telemetry or step down units)
2. Ambulatory care setting with previous ICU experience (preferably within 3 years)
3. Paramedics, EMTs or RNs and medical assistants/LPN that work in urgent care
Figure 3. SCCM Tiered Critical Care Staffing Strategy for Pandemic. APP: advanced practice provider; RT: respiratory therapist; CRNA: certified registered nurse anesthetist; MD/DO: physician [modified from SCCM link above].(45)
 critical care teams may be directed by anesthesiologists,
 pulmonologists, hospitalists, or others with experience caring for critically ill patients.(45)

vii. Step-down Care/Intermediate Care Ward (ICW). Figure 4 provides a framework staffing model for patients requiring more intensive support but not mechanical ventilation/vasopressor support, or those at imminent risk of requiring mechanical ventilation/vasopressor support, such as could be managed in a step-down unit. Ideally, this team would be led by an experienced hospitalist or intensivist who oversees the care of physician-led teams. Ideally, these staffing models would be supported by a minimum of two teams working no longer than 12-hour shifts. (38) In the setting of COVID-19, these are likely patients that would be hospitalized in fixed facilities by not in ICUs.
Figure 4. Tier 2 Staffing Strategy for Step-down Level Care during a Pandemic
viii. Routine Inpatient/Ward Care. Figure 5 provides a framework staffing model for inpatient routine medicine care, with an ideal team led by an experienced hospitalist or physician with hospital experience. In the setting of COVID-19, these would likely be patients housed in “off-site” facilities with limited resources (e.g., tents, gyms, convention centers, etc).
Figure 5. Tier 3 Staffing Strategy for Routine Ward Level Care during a Pandemic
vii. Pediatric Care. For MTFs that have a large footprint of pediatric providers (pediatric residencies, pediatric intensivists, pediatricians, pediatric nursing), there should be consideration to flex pediatric age range up to 30 in the Contingency Stage. This will leverage appropriate expertise to care for young adults, which is common both for these providers especially in the military, and offload patient numbers from the adult care teams. For smaller MTFs that have minimal pediatric beds, minimal pediatricians (i.e., Family Practice caring for children), there should be consideration of diverting inpatient pediatric patients to dedicated children's hospitals. This decision should be made based on available community capacity and there should be communication with local facilities to strategically plan for patient distributions. MTFs must still maintain dedicated non- COVID-19 medical missions, and should not sacrifice care in other areas (e.g., use NICU beds/ventilators for adult patients if needed in the NICU).

Clinical Management of COVID-19
b. Privileging Options. In accordance with national standards for accreditation, local leadership may cross- level providers to provide patient care, treatment and services necessary as a life-saving or harm reducing measures, provided the care, treatment, and services are within the scope of the individual's license without modification of existing privileges. Disaster privileges can only be granted to volunteer licensed independent practitioners when the organization’s Emergency Operations Plan has been activated. During emergencies, providers undergoing “just in time” training for work outside their normal areas may work within the scope of their individual licensure and do not require privilege modification, addition or supervision. Privileging authorities may award disaster privileges on activation of their emergency management plans consistent with provisions established in DHA PM 6025.13, Volume 4.
2. Staff Training.
a. ICU “Just in time training” for augmentees are available at https://www.sccm.org/covid19,
https://www.chestnet.org/Guidelines-and-Resources/COVID-19/On-Demand-e-Learning, https://www.chestnet.org/Guidelines-and-Resources/COVID-19/Updates-and-Resources, https://www.sccm.org/disaster, and https://covid19toolbox.com.
b. Training and augmentation platforms.
• If local expertise is not available, utilization of existing DHA teleconsultation platforms (PATH,
ADVISOR) may augment capabilities.
• Places with ICU care should develop brief local ICU orientation models focusing on safety
practices, unit hierarchy, protocols, and consultative relationships (brief, max 4-8 hours).
• Training platforms for provider and nursing augmentees should focus on remote learning
resources to provide baseline didactic training such as those above or those locally developed.
c. Critical care considerations for pregnant women online training is available at:
https://www.smfm.org/critical-care/cases/new-2019.
d. DHE Clinical RN Refresher Training Packet was released with the intent of helping to refresh inpatient
nursing experience. (https://info.health.mil/edu/Pages/COVID.aspx)
e. PPE; Donning and doffing officers should be assigned to train and monitor, which can be personnel pulled
from non-clinical roles (administrators, support staff, etc.) that can fulfill a vital safety role after being
trained. Training video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG6zISnenPg (46)
3. Equipment and Consumables. Daily assessment of ventilators, ventilator circuits, PPE, fluids, and sedating
medication should be tracked with equipment burn rates estimated and updated as information is available.
a. Consider creating intubation/procedure packs with all necessary equipment and supplies to avoid going in
and out of the room repeatedly.
b. Consider alternative options to reduce and re-use critical items such as PPE and ventilator circuits.
Encourage sharing local policies and solutions as they become available.
c. Consider utilization of anesthesia ventilators during expansion, but ensure some remain in reserve based
on facility needs for acute, non-COVID-19 emergencies.
d. Inventory management.
• Develop a list of key inventory to include PPE, ventilators and supporting equipment, fluids, key medications, fluids, nutrition, IV and other vascular access supplies, etc.
• Assign personnel to develop a tracking system and publish regularly to ICC. Utilize models to predict inventory burn rate. A sample PPE utilization calculator available at: https://www.chestnet.org/Guidelines-and-Resources/Resources/Essential-Institutional-Supply- Chain-Management-in-the-Setting-of-COVID-19-Pandemic (47)
4. Space:
a. ICU Contingency Units. Many modern ICUs have rooms capable of expanding to hold two patients. These
spaces need to be assessed to house appropriate ventilators, suction, and monitoring, but if so equipped, should be utilized first. Co-locating COVID-19 patients as much as possible will increase the efficiency of staff and supply use. If these spaces are exhausted, other monitored, ventilator capably areas may be available to use as alternative ICU rooms (OR, PACU, etc).
b. Ward Cohorting: Consideration should be given to establishing COVID-19 wards. Clean barriers on open units similar to chemical “hot lines” can be used. This includes cohorting staff to “COVID-positive” or “COVID-negative” teams based on which cohort they are caring for to reduce transmission. If possible,
          Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 10

Clinical Management of COVID-19
COVID-19 inpatient care should be limited to specific areas of the hospital with designated travel routes reserved for flow of COVID-19 positive patients.
Establishment of a DoD Case Registry for Clinical Performance Improvement.
1. Systematic collection and iterative analysis of key clinical data is essential to optimize delivery of care.
2. The registry currently being implemented will support performance improvement in the setting of a
learning health system.
3. Standardized electronic health record (EHR) templates have been developed to increase harmonization
and completeness of important data elements needed for the registry.
Returning to the “New Normal”
The decision to de-escalate from contingency and crisis care should be governed by similar principles with ICC coordination, triggers for phased de-escalation, and clear communication. The risk of prolonged delay in routine care or altered practice models creating urgent or emergent care needs and increasing morbidity and mortality should be considered as the decision of when/how to transition back to more normal care models. Additionally, institutions should recognize and plan for a prolonged period (months or longer) with low level COVID-19 care needs requiring cohorted outpatient, emergency, and inpatient services as much as possible to avoid Healthcare associated spread. Plans should be in place with clear triggers to re-escalate to contingency or crisis care with the relaxing of social distancing.
SCREENING AND TRIAGE: EARLY RECOGNITION OF PATIENTS WITH COVID-19
1. Screening: Screen and isolate all patients with suspected COVID-19 at the first point of contact with the health care system (ER/clinic/drive-through screening/labor and delivery). Establish processes for how to handle people screening positive at entrances. Processes should be clear and easy to follow and be standardized across facilities within the Local Command. It is also recommended to direct low-risk patients to drive-through screening facilities as available to reduce exposure and conserve PPE in MTFs.
2. Triage: Triage patients using standardized triage tools and initiate the appropriate disposition decision depending on the clinical setting. Ensure standard protocols established in cooperation with Infectious Disease and Public Health that are clear and easy for staff to follow. Try to keep protocols aligned with national (CDC) and local (state or municipal) guidance and update regularly as new guidance emerges. Triage should be conducted telephonically or in a designated outdoor or dirty area when possible. Staff evaluating patients face-to-face should be pre-identified and outfitted and trained on appropriate PPE. Patients can pre-screen themselves using available self-checkers from the CDC and other organizations.
a. A potentially useful tool for initial categorization of clinical severity and aiding in triage is the National
Early Warning Score (NEWS), Figure 6. This clinically derived score is easily measured in a triage area, clinic,
emergency department or other initial assessment environment and consists of parameters listed below.
b. The score ranges from 0-21 and higher scores have been demonstrated to correlate with worsened
mortality. A score of above 5 increases the likelihood of eventual ICU level of care.(48)
c. NEWS in COVID-19 has distinct advantages over qSOFA which can underestimate the severity of
presentation if confusion, and hypotension are absent as they often are in COVID-19 patients.
3. Initial treatment of hospitalized inpatients consists of optimized supportive and symptomatic care in the ward
or intensive care unit. Patients with increased risk of severe disease and mortality include:
 Age >60
 Diabetes mellitus
 Hypertension
 Immunosuppression
 Cardiopulmonary disease
4. Patients may present with mild symptoms but have high risk of deterioration and should be admitted to a
designated unit for close monitoring.
a. Additional consideration should be given to a patient’s resource level in their residence, and ability to
quarantine and self-monitor when deciding to admit or discharge a mildly symptomatic patient.

5. Mild Illness. For mild illness, hospitalization may not be required unless concern about rapid deterioration. Isolation to contain/mitigate virus transmission should be prioritized. Safe home care can be performed according to CDC guidance (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-home-care.html).
6. ICU Admission Criteria. ICU admission and exclusion criteria may be a fluid decision based on the facility. Given that allocation of dedicated ICU beds and surge capabilities amongst individual hospitals are variable, each hospital should provide a specific plan regarding ICU admission/exclusion criteria. This could be based on the percentage of resources utilized (e.g., beds, ventilators). An example plan is provided below.

 IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION OF APPROPRIATE Infection Prevention Control (IPC) MEASURES/PPE
1. All employees working in inpatient units, ambulatory clinic spaces, and procedural areas should wear a surgical face mask, at all times, while in their respective clinical care settings. Such requirements align with current policies from leading healthcare systems, including the University of Nebraska. Additional information can be found at the following link: https://www.nebraskamed.com/sites/default/files/documents/covid-19/surgical-mask- policy-and-faq-nebraska-med.pdf.

Special Situations: ED staff and outpatient healthcare workers with any patient encounter with a PUI: Follow Category 2.
2. Appropriate use of PPE plays an important role in the prevention of disease transmission, however ensuring appropriate work practice and environmental controls are in place is critical. In addition to implementing the PPE guidelines provided in Figure 8, MTFs should adhere to the following essential practices:
a. Screen all visitors and healthcare workers before entry into the MTF (i.e., inside as they enter).
b. Implement restricted visitation policies for the facility (refer to example provided by Emory Healthcare: http://www.emoryhealthcare.org/covid/index.html, no federal endorsement is intended or implied)
c. Practice social distancing
d. Adhere to frequent hand hygiene and wear a surgical or cloth mask at all times (includes visitors).
e. Surgical masks are preferred over cloth masks for healthcare personnel. Consider continuing to wear
respirator or facemask (extended use) while in the facility instead of intermittently switching back to
cloth face covering which could cause self-contamination.

4. Questions related to IPC can be sent to: dha.ncr.clinic-support.list.ipc-group@mail.mil
COLLECTION OF SPECIMENS FOR LABORATORY DIAGNOSIS
1. Triage: Patients should be triaged and initial testing optimally performed in a manner separated from the general patient population such as in a tent or designated area within a facility. Initial laboratory collection will include nasopharyngeal swab for COVID-19 testing and additional tests as indicated.
2. Specimen Collection: Collect specimens from the upper respiratory tract (URT), as viral density/load is highest in the nasal cavity and nasopharynx. Nasopharygeal swabs are preferred compared to washings or other methods, as these increase the risk of aerosolization and transmission of the virus. If unable to collect from the URT, consider collecting specimens from the lower respiratory tract (LRT) using expectorated sputum or endotracheal aspirate. Testing for other viral infections such as influenza should be obtained, or if available a respiratory viral panel (i.e. Biofire). Avoid bronchoscopy and nasal endoscopy to minimize aerosolization.(49)
3. Confirming COVID-19:
a. Diagnosis of COVID-19 is primarily confirmed by nucleic acid amplification techniques (NAAT) of SARS-CoV-
2. The most common tests are real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests,
but other NAATs (in-situ hybridization and others) are also used.
b. The CDC’s PCR assay received emergency use authorization (EUA) on 3Mar20. Since then numerous
commercial laboratories and universities have developed assays with subsequent approval.(50)
c. These assays are, in general, highly specific, but the sensitivity may depend on the disease process (mild
upper respiratory infection vs severe pulmonary disease) and the site of specimen collection. At this time there are few data available to assess sensitivity of these assays and even fewer data to evaluate the assays based on clinical specimen type.
d. Nasopharyngeal swab specimens are most commonly recommended as noted above; however in an intubated patient tracheal aspirates should also be obtained. The majority of data on sensitivity of NAATs from different specimen sites are from retrospective, descriptive data from cohorts of Chinese patients with COVID-19. One manuscript describing 1070 specimens from 205 patients with COVID-19 suggested that LRT samples were most likely to be positive for viral RNA.(51)
e. Consider retesting if clinical suspicion for COVID-19 remains (false-negative results possible).
f. Comparing sensitivity of nucleic acid testing to the experience of Chinese and other researchers may have
limitations. The WHO assay uses RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, whereas the CDC assay targets genes which target viral nucleocapsid genes (N genes). One non-peer reviewed publication suggested that the nucleocapsid assays have higher sensitivity than the WHO assay. As a result, any data on sensitivity from a NAAT performed under the WHO assay (to include reports from China) may underestimate sensitivity of assays in the United States.(52)
g. Serologic assays have been developed to assess antibody response to COVID-19 infection. As of 3 April the FDA issued the first EUA for an IgG/IgM assay for SARS CoV-2. Over 70 assays have been developed and are being marketed; the FDA has neither evaluated nor approved those tests, and the performance of these tests is unknown. On 22 April the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) advised against use of serologic testing as a screening for patient due to high rates of false-positive (likely secondary to cross- reactivity to other coronaviruses), and false-negative results (as the development of antibody response is inconsistent).(53) On 24 April the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a statement warning that prior infection with SARS CoV-2 has not been proven to confer immunity to reinfection.(54)
4. Hospitalized Patients: In hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19, repeated URT and LRT samples can be

Clinical Management of COVID-19
collected to demonstrate viral clearance. The frequency of specimen collection will depend on local epidemic characteristics and resources. Initially, the CDC recommended 2 negative tests after clinical recovery to document clearance. This is no longer recommended. Prolonged positivity of PCR testing in patients who have clinically recovered is being reported. Follow-up testing after clinical improvement may result in unnecessary prolongation of hospitalization and excess utilization of scarce laboratory resources.
5. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): Use appropriate PPE for specimen collection (droplet and contact precautions for URT specimens; airborne precautions for LRT specimens).
6. For pregnant and recently postpartum patients: COVID-19 testing of symptomatic women may need to be prioritized due to need for inpatient care with delivery and ongoing outpatient visits, to enable access to specialized care, to allow appropriate maternal PPE, and appropriate care for the newborn.
7. Co-infection: Dual infections with other respiratory viral and bacterial infections have been found in SARS, MERS and COVID-19 patients. As a result, a positive test for a non-COVID-19 pathogen does not rule out COVID-19. At this stage, detailed viral and microbiologic studies are needed in all suspected cases.
MANAGEMENT OF COVID-19 BASED ON ILLNESS CATEGORY
Per National Institutes of Health (NIH) COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines, in general, patients with COVID-19 can be grouped into the following illness categories:(55)
 Asymptomatic or Pre-symptomatic Infection: Individuals who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 but have no symptoms
 Mild Illness: Individuals who have any of various signs and symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, sore throat, malaise, headache, muscle pain) without shortness of breath, dyspnea, or abnormal imaging
 Moderate Illness: Individuals who have evidence of lower respiratory disease by clinical assessment or imaging and a saturation of oxygen (SaO2) >93% on room air at sea level.
 Severe Illness: Individuals who have respiratory frequency >30 breaths per minute, SaO2 ≤93% on room air at sea level, ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) <300, or lung infiltrates >50%.
 Critical Illness: Individuals who have respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction. OUTPATIENT MANAGEMENT OF COVID-19: SYMPTOMATIC TREATMENT AND MONITORING
1. Overall management: The mainstay of treatment for mild cases of COVID-19 is supportive care.
2. Disposition: Those with mild or moderate disease may be managed as an outpatient. Moderate cases should
be considered for admission for close observation due to the risk of rapid pulmonary disease progression. The determination of outpatient vs inpatient care should be individualized based on consideration of symptom severity, risks for adverse outcomes (e.g., underlying illness and age), and the patient’s social context:
a. Their access to resources such as food and other necessities for daily living
b. Their access to appropriate caregivers or ability to engage in self-care
c. Their ability to engage in symptom and public-health monitoring
d. The transmission risk within the home (e.g., the availability of a separate bedroom to minimize sharing of
immediate living spaces; their access to PPE such as gloves and a facemask; their ability to adhere to home isolation, respiratory and hand hygiene, and environmental cleaning; and household members at increased risk for COVID-19 complications).(15, 56, 57)
3. Monitoring for symptomatic progression: Monitoring for the evolution of symptoms may be conducted by clinical staff or public-health personnel, depending on local policy.
a. Although 81% of patients in a Chinese case series had mild symptoms, those who progressed to more
severe disease were hospitalized a median of 7-11 days after the onset of illness.(4, 9, 58) Therefore, close monitoring for symptomatic progression through the second week of illness is important for non- hospitalized patients.
b. Close monitoring should be emphasized in any patient who is identified as being at higher risk for severe
    Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 15

Clinical Management of COVID-19
illness per CDC guidelines at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-
precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html. Monitoring via telehealth may be an option for these patients.
4. Home care guidance: Healthcare providers may provide patients and caregivers with available CDC guidance
on home care:
a. Preventing the Spread of Coronavirus Disease in Homes and Residential Communities
(https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-prevent-spread.html)
b. What to Do If You Are Sick (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html)
c. Caring for Someone at Home (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/care-for-someone.html)
d. Caring for Yourself at Home (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/caring-for-yourself-at-home.html)
5. Targeted therapy: There are currently no approved or proven targeted therapies for the treatment of COVID-19. While the majority of clinical trials are focused on hospitalized patients, there are a growing number of clinical trials targeting mild, outpatient cases and investigating the use of repurposed antiviral, antimalarial, and immunomodulatory agents, among others. Further information and updates can be found at https://www.clinicaltrials.gov. The NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines (https://covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/introduction/) provides updated recommendations and supporting evidence for antiviral therapy and immunomodulatory agents.
6. Concomitant medications: The NIH Guidelines provide recommendations and supporting evidence regarding the role of concomitant medications such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), corticosteroids, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), and non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).(55)
7. Discontinuation of home isolation: Clinicians should contact local military public health and/or local/state health departments regarding criteria for discontinuation of home isolation and establish clear and easy- to-follow protocols to guide staff, patients, and commands on return to work/duty criteria.(57) Local implementation of discontinuation strategies may be based on availability of testing supplies, laboratory capacity, and community access to testing. Local authorities may also consider differential application of discontinuation strategies to unique populations based on their risk for transmission to susceptible contacts (e.g., following a test-based strategy for healthcare workers or those living in congregate settings, such as nursing-home residents or basic trainees, vs a non-test-based strategy for the general population). Military bases or units may have administrative requirements for service members to be able to return to work/duty independent of clinical standards. Examples of such protocols can be found in Appendix B.
The CDC guidelines for discontinuing isolation can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019- ncov/hcp/disposition-in-home-patients.html.
MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE COVID-19: TREATMENT OF CO-INFECTIONS
1. Clinical judgment and patient severity will dictate provider decision on early antibiotic therapy.
2. Procalcitonin levels have been low in COVID-19 mono-infection, with minimal bacterial co-infections reported
except in pediatric patients where >80% are reported to be elevated.(59)
3. Post-mortem results reported from China suggest concern for Aspergillus pulmonary superinfections in
critically-ill patients. This is well-described in severe influenza as well. The optimum diagnostic strategy remains to be determined, but a syndrome of worsening fever, hypoxemia, and airspace opacification in a previously-improving patient may suggest secondary aspergillosis. Diagnostic options include serum 1,3-beta- D-glucan and galactomannan assays and (potentially) galactomannan measurement in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, although bronchoscopy should be performed only if no less-invasive option is available and only in airborne infection isolation rooms (AIIRs) with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). The culture of Aspergillus from tracheal aspirates or BAL is suggestive but not diagnostic.
4. Recommend empiric antimicrobials for intubated patients with COVID-19. The recommended empiric antibiotic therapy is as per the 2019 ATS/IDSA Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) guidelines or as per critical care or infectious disease consultation.(60) As a starting point upon intubation, Table 1 can be used until consultation is available:
5. Recommend obtaining blood cultures and tracheal aspirate prior to initiation of antibiotics if feasible.

Clinical Management of COVID-19
6. As noted in section on diagnostic testing, co-detection of other respiratory pathogens has been observed with SARS-CoV-2. For example, Stanford researchers recently provided rapid communication of experience with 562 SARS-CoV-2 tests; of 49 positive SARS-COV-2 results, 11 (22.4%) also had a co- infection, and of 127 positive for other viruses, 11 (8.66%) had a SARS-COV-2 co-infection.

MANAGEMENT OF CRITICAL COVID-19: OXYGEN & ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS)
1. Give supplemental oxygen therapy immediately to patients with respiratory distress, hypoxemia, or shock and target SpO2 92-96%.(61, 62) Hyperoxia (PaO2 >225mmHg) should be avoided and is associated with worse outcomes.(63)
2. Begin with low flow nasal cannula (1-6 L/min) followed by high flow nasal cannula (Figure 10).
3. High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC). Although an area of controversy, early expert opinion favors HFNC over other
NIV modalities (https://emcrit.org/ibcc/COVID-19/#high_flow_nasal_cannula) because it appears to be well tolerated and less aerosolizing. There is presently no definitive evidence that HFNC augments transmission of virus, however HFNC will disperse air farther the higher the flow is set, (but not as far as CPAP). (64) A surgical mask should be placed over the HFNC in an effort to minimize aerosolization risk. Consider intubation for higher flow rates (>40 L/min), especially if the patient is not in a negative pressure room.
4. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV). It is recommended to avoid NIV because of increased aerosolization generated by the facemask and lack of an exhalation filter. If there is an exception to this such as patients that chronically use NIV or DNI patients, these patients will require airborne isolation regardless of ICU/acute care status.
5. Helmet ventilation. The helmet can be connected to either a BiPAP circuit or a HFNC circuit (up to 60 L of flow) to increase the PEEP that the patient receives.(65, 66) The helmet has a tight seal around the neck and should decrease the amount of leak usually seen with mask interface NIV (such as BiPAP and CPAP). In one study comparing helmet to mask NIV with ARDS, there was a decreased rate of intubations.(66) There has been concern that CO2 washout was inefficient using the helmet,(67) but a follow up study did not support that concern.(65) Helmet ventilation can prevent aersolizing the virus.
6. Awake proning of non-intubated patients is currently being performed at some hospitals across the world.(68) A retrospective study of 15 non-intubated, hypoxemic patients placed in the prone position showed improvement of oxygenation. The effects were not sustained upon supine positioning.(69) See Appendix C for full protocol for prone positioning of non-intubated patients.
7. Aggressive fluid resuscitation may worsen oxygenation and outcomes in both children and adults, so in the absence of shock, fluid boluses should be minimized. Consider no more than 30 ml/kg ideal body weight (IBW) of isotonic crystalloid for adult patients, assuming no ongoing active fluid losses (e.g., from diarrhea).
Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 17
   
Clinical Management of COVID-19
8. Avoid nebulizers, as metered dose inhalers are recommended for staff protection/avoidance of aerosols.(49)
9. Admission studies and labs: Consider the following diagnostic studies in Table 2 for diagnosis, prognosis and
risk stratification (and/or safety of agents) for all hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 and for PUIs.
10. Due to infection prevention needs, do not allow ICU visitors during a pandemic except under exigent
circumstances.
11. Facilities should assess daily operational status via huddle of equipment including ventilators, medications
(e.g. anelgesics, sedatives, and paralytics), and staffing (including respiratory therapists, physicians and nursing) and initiate contingency or crisis standards of care as appropriate.

Endotracheal Intubation
1. Decision to intubate: Recent non-peer reviewed references regarding COVID-19 respiratory support should be
considered with caution. Neither a practice of ‘early intubation’ (reflexive decisions to intubate once a patient requires more than 5-6 L/m of oxygen), nor ‘permissive hypoxemia/happy-hypoxemic’ (allowing patients to persist with an oxygen saturation of lower than 80% for prolonged duration in order to avoid harms of intubation and mechanical ventilation) are evidence based. However, in the absence of significant clinical experience or high quality evidence with COVID-19 ventilation, it may be reasonable to not intubate select patients with stable mild hypoxemia on supplemental oxygen, but low PaCO2 and without signs or symptoms of end-organ damage who demonstrate pulmonary shunt physiology for which intubation would not be expected to help.(70) Clinical decisions to intubate should be based on existing evidence-based guidelines balanced with evolving knowledge regarding COVID-19 and preserving healthcare staff safety.
2. Clear indications to intubate include progressive hypoxia and worsening chest infiltrates, hypercarbia or decreasing mental status, and progressive dyspnea.
3. Intubation (along with subsequent extubation) has the highest risk of aerosolization and exposure to COVID- 19 of all procedures, and the person performing intubation is most at risk.(49) For this reason, the most experienced person should perform endotracheal intubation to reduce exposure to the healthcare team and all team members should be in appropriate PPE with PAPR during intubation. If PAPR is unavailable, an appropriate alternative may be the M50 CBRN gas mask. If these options are not available, N95, hair cover, gown, double gloves, face shields, goggles, and shoe covers should be used, along with a protective clear plastic cover over the patient to optimize protection for the providers. Consider intubation teams and limit the number of staff members during airway manipulation to reduce unnecessary exposure. (https://www.apsf.org/news-updates/perioperative-considerations-for-the-2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19/)
4. A pre-intubation checklist is encouraged, which should include supplies to be brought inside the room by specific team members and others that should remain outside the room. Appendix D provides an example
Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 18
    
Clinical Management of COVID-19
intubation checklist (adapted from University of Washington). Note: a disposable stethoscope should be used
to avoid viral transfer and staff should touch as little as possible in the room to avoid fomites.
5. For patients with a normal airway assessment, awake intubation should be avoided and modified RSI with sufficient muscle relaxation is strongly encouraged. For patients with difficult airways, good preparation of airway devices and detailed intubation plans should be made in advance.(71)
6. Some centers have advocated for further reducing exposure during pre-oxygenation and ventilation through preparing an additional COVID-19 Intubation Pack, in addition to intubation meds, a video laryngoscope (if used, or direct laryngoscopy), and a non-vented BiPAP mask. The following video demonstrates the set-up: (https://youtu.be/C78VTEAHhWU).
7. Appendix E provides a framework for intubation with medications and doses, although this is not a substitute for clinical judgement.
8. Additional cognitive aids have been developed and might be useful. Appendix F provides examples.
9. Extubation: While the risks of aerosolization of COVID-19 during intubation have been well described there has been less attention paid to extubation. During intubation, particularly with RSI, paralytics limit coughing
and patient movement. During extubation coughing can be pronounced and difficult to control. A protective algorithm similar to intubation should be used for extubation. Appendix G provides an example protocol, which was adapted from University Medical Center in Las Vegas, NV.
Management of ARDS after Intubation 1. Mechanical Ventilation.
  It has been reported that many patients with COVID-19 pneumonia are initially
 characterized by a low elastance and high compliance despite severe hypoxemia, which is generally not
 observed in typical ARDS.(72) They presented the concept of a “Light” or “L” type with near normal lung
 compliance and severe hypoxemia due to a low V/Q ratio as a result of the loss of hypoxemic
 vasoconstriction. These patients have low lung recruitability. The so called “heavy” or “H” type is more
 typical of ARDS with high elastance and low lung compliance and hypoxemia due to shunting through
 nonventilated areas of lung that are presumably recruitable.(73) It has been postulated that a high PEEP
 strategy in the “L” type may be ineffective and cause cardiovascular impairment while in the “H” type
 may lead to increased recruitment of nonventilated lung and improved oxygenation. It is likely that there
 is a spectrum of lung pathologies with the “L” type on one end and the “H” type on the other with most
 patients falling somewhere in-between or progressing towards the “H” type throughout the course of
 their illness. Despite these differences the best available data demonstrates that a low tidal volume
 approach with appropriate PEEP as described below is the most effective treatments strategy for
 ARDS.(62, 74)
a. Target an ARDSnet lung-protective strategy (4-8 mL/kg ideal body weight), and lower inspiratory pressures (plateau pressure <30 cm H2O).(62, 74)
i. Start with 6 mL/kg ideal body weight tidal volume and titrate to as high as 8 mL/kg as long as the lungs are compliant.
ii. In patients with moderate to severe ARDS, suggest titrating to a higher PEEP as tolerated. PEEP tables are available to guide titration: http://www.ardsnet.org/tools.shtml
b. Permissive hypercapnia ensuring adequate hemodynamics and a pH >7.15 may be tolerated
c. Humidification will likely be needed to manage thick secretions. However, keep in mind the risk
of aerosolization associated with breaking the circuit to change heat and moisture exchangers (HME) if this is all that is available. Ventilators with heated humidifiers do not require breaking the circuit to humidify the inspiratory limb and are preferred. Consider clamping the ETT during any circuit breaks.
2. Proning. Evidence has shown that patients who are unable to adequately ventilate in the supine position may benefit from being placed in the prone position to improve oxygen saturation (PaO2), pulmonary mechanics, and arterial blood gases (ABGs).(75-79) Anecdotal reports from Italy and Singapore have found that patients with COVID-19 usually respond well to early pronation.(68)
a. Prone positioning requires proper sedation/pain medications and paralytic agents if necessary.
b. Length of pronation cycle should be a minimum of 16 hours in the prone position with a return to
supine positioning at least once a day.
 Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 19

Clinical Management of COVID-19
c. Prone positioning should be performed as clinically indicated within the first 24 hours of the diagnosis of severe hypoxemia.
d. Recommend use of a manual proning protocol with coordination if mechanical beds are not available. Appendix C provides an example protocol, which was adapted from University Medical Center in Las Vegas, NV. Additional protocols (including videos) are available.(80)
e. Pregnancy is not a contraindication for proning or neuromuscular blockade.(81)
f. Consider the facility and staff safety and capacity for proning. Proning requires significant PPE
and personnel resources (occupy staff in patient room for prolonged period of time). Circuit disconnection and loss of vascular access are among potential risks. The loss of manpower during proning and repositioning may be a contraindication in resource limited environments.
3. Neuromuscular Blockade. In patients with moderate-severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2<150), neuromuscular blockade by continuous infusion should not be routinely used, but may be considered in the setting of worsening hypoxia or hypercapnia and in situations where the patient's respiratory drive cannot be managed with sedation alone resulting in ventilator dyssynchrony and lung decruitment.
4. Airway suctioning. Use in-line catheters for airway suctioning and clamp endotracheal tube when disconnection is required (for example, transfer to a transport ventilator). Avoid disconnecting the patient from the ventilator, which results in loss of PEEP and atelectasis.
5. Bronchoscopy. Routine diagnostic bronchoscopy (including nasal endoscopy or any instrumentation of this area) is not recommended. It is not necessary for the diagnosis of viral pneumonia and should be avoided to minimize aerosolization. Tracheal aspirate samples for diagnosis of COVD-19 are usually sufficient. If bronchoscopy is required for another reason, it should be performed with the same level of PPE as recommended for intubation.

Clinical Management of COVID-19
6. Inhaled nitric oxide and prostacyclin. There is no evidence for routine use of inhaled nitric oxide, prostacyclin or other selective pulmonary vasodilators in acute respiratory failure. However, during emerging infectious disease outbreaks when resources are exhausted, inhaled nitric oxide and prostacyclin may be considered as a temporizing measure when patients develop refractory hypoxemia despite prone ventilation, or in the presence of contraindications to proning or ECMO.Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). In settings with access to expertise in ECMO, consider referral of patients who have refractory hypoxemia despite lung protective ventilation who are otherwise appropriate candidates. For more information: https://www.elso.org/COVID-19.
Oxygen Delivery and Mechanical Ventilation in Settings with Resource Limitations
1. As the COVID-19 pandemic places additional strain on available resources, the supplies of available
ventilators may not meet clinical demand of patients in respiratory failure in need of invasive positive pressure ventilation (IPPV). Facilities should assess respiratory support operational status daily to account for equipment including ventilators, medications (induction agents, anxiolytics, sedatives, analgesics and paralytics), and staffing (respiratory therapists, providers and nurses).
2. Facilities must be prepared with alternate methods to support patients requiring IPPV in the event the number of patients with respiratory failure exceeds the number of ventilators. Alternate strategies in a crisis resource-limited clinical environment include the following:(82-85)
a. Deliver manual breaths via a manual resuscitator (“self-inflating bag”).
b. Transport mechanical ventilators may be used for prolonged ventilation of stable patients in the
MTF (e.g. Impact 754 and 731 transport ventilators, see Appendix H), but need to be used with
a viral filter.
c. Ventilators in storage (Home Station Medical Response materiel, War Reserve Material, and
national stockpiles)
d. Anesthesia gas machines capable of providing controlled ventilation or assisted ventilation
outside of the traditional use for anesthetic indication.
e. Some non-invasive ventilators (e.g., for CPAP or BiPAP) can be used for invasive mechanical
ventilation, but should only be used if the standard ventilator supply is exhausted and it is confirmed with the manufacturer (e.g V60) that they are invasive capable and can deliver prescribed breaths. In this case, a HEPA filter should be inserted into the expiratory limb to prevent aerosolization.
3. Conserve accessories used with ventilators, but use viral filters if available. Consider extending the duration of use of breathing circuit supplies and in-line heat and moisture exchangers for treating individual patients.(82)
4. In accordance with professional society consensus statements, U.S. Public Health Service, and FDA guidance:(82, 83, 85)
a. Use FDA-cleared conventional/standard full-featured ventilators to support patients with respiratory failure.
b. Use one ventilator per patient, matching ventilator settings with the patient’s individual respiratory requirements.
c. While ventilators may have mechanical capacity to split circuits to support multiple patients, it is excessively difficult to safely implement. There is insufficient body of evidence to support consistent application of this practice. Neither research using animals and test lungs nor case reports of crisis or contingency application of this technique establish clinical safety.
MANAGEMENT OF CRITICAL ILLNESS AND COVID-19: PREVENTION OF COMPLICATIONS
Cardiovascular Disease (CVD)
Cardiovascular comorbidities and the presence of CVD are common in patients with COVID-19 infections. The presence of CVD and risk factors correlate with increasing age, and are associated with increased mortality.(86-88)
1. Troponins and Basic Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) Evaluation. Elevated troponin is common (especially high Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 21
   
Clinical Management of COVID-19
sensitivity troponin), which is a strong predictor of mortality. Mild troponin elevation often does not represent a type-I (plaque rupture) myocardial infarction. The concentrations of BNP/NT-proBNP reflect the presence or extent of pre-existing cardiac disease or the acute hemodynamic stress. Troponin value, velocity of change in troponin level, elevated BNP/NT-proBNP and echocardiographic imaging should guide the management of the elevated biomarkers, although current opinion advises that troponin and BNP should only be measured if clinical evaluation suggests acute coronary syndrome or heart failure.(89)
2. Electrocardiogram (ECG). Recommend ECG in suspected or acute coronary syndrome. May consider of obtaining from cardiac tele-monitoring screen.(89)
3. Echocardiogram. An echocardiogram should only be ordered if it is likely to provide clinical benefit. Consider repeat echocardiograms only for clear change in clinical status. Point of Care Ultrasound (POCUS) exams may be used to screen/triage patients. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) requests should only be considered when no other alternative imaging modalities are available as the procedure may be aerosol producing.(90)
4. Acute Myocardial Injury.
a. Definition: An algorithm for the interpretation of myocardial injury is provided for reference and is
based on the 4th Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction.(91)
b. Incidence and Prognosis: Recent reports found that up to 19% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19,
have a combination of elevated cardiac biomarkers, in addition to electrocardiographic and echocardiographic abnormalities.(3, 4, 9, 92) There are two patterns of myocardial injury, one pattern of a continued rise with inflammatory markers, and a second pattern similar to the pattern seen in patients with predominantly cardiac symptoms.(93) Myocardial injury appears to be a late manifestation (up to 14 days from illness onset) and has been found to be independently associated with an increased risk of mortality.(4, 89, 92)
c. Evaluation: Cardiac Computed Tomography (CCTA): There may be a role for the use of CCTA as a non- invasive means to rule out significant coronary pathology as a cause of myocardial injury. Assessment for the appropriateness of testing and imaging protocols should be made in conjunction with a consulting Cardiologist and Radiologist as capabilities are site specific.(94)
5. Myocarditis.
a. Incidence: In a case series of 150 patients with COVID-19 patients, nearly 10% of deaths were attributed
to myocarditis with circulatory failure, and in 33% of cases it was believed to have contributed as a
mechanism for multisystem organ failure.(95)
b. Diagnosis: There is currently no role for endocardial biopsy. POCUS at initial evaluation to help protocol
TTE. Serial TTE/POCUS only if it will impact management.
c. Management: Supportive care depending on hemodynamic status. There are case reports on different
treatment strategies, but none are validated by clinical trials.(89)
6. Acute Coronary Syndrome.
a. Incidence: Based on available published data, there is a potential symptom overlap between acute coronary syndrome and COVID-19 infection.(2)
b. Evaluation: Goal is to differentiate acute plaque rupture, demand related ischemia or myocarditis. Recommendation is for cardiology consultation when unable to determine etiology.
i. ST segment elevation on the 12 lead EKG has been reported in the absence of coronary thrombosis or spasms in COVID-19 patients.(86) The mechanism for these EKG changes is uncertain but is felt to be attributable to myocarditis vs possible endothelial dysfunction with micro thrombus formation.(86, 96) Confirmation of a wall motion abnormality, indicating regional myocardial ischemia, can be made with POCUS prior to invasive angiography to aid selecting a revascularization strategy. Each MTF should consider individualizing its approach to the STEMI patients based on local expertise and patient characteristics.
c. Management: Once the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome is made, medical management should be coordinated with cardiology.
i. Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory Considerations: As most cardiac catheterization laboratories are either normal or positive pressure rooms, the benefits of invasive therapeutics must be weighed against the transmission risk to staff and patients. Deferral of invasive management can be
Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 22

Clinical Management of COVID-19
considered based on these factors in favor of medical stabilization if necessary. Patients with borderline or deteriorating respiratory status should be considered for intubation prior to transport to the laboratory. Right heart catheterization, pericardiocentesis, and intra-aortic balloon pump placement can be done at bedside when appropriate. Fibrinolytic protocols should be reviewed at each institution with cardiology to discuss care plans if strained resources.(97)
7. Cardiac Dysrrhythmias.
a. Incidence: Common CV manifestation in COVID-19 patients. Current cases series report an occurrence of
unspecified arrhythmias in 17% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (44% of ICU patients vs 7% non ICU patients).(4) The new onset of malignant tachydysrrhythmias in combination with acute myocardial injury should raise suspicion for potential underlying myocarditis.(2)
b. Management: Follow recently published COVID-19 specific ACLS/PALS protocols.(98) In patients with atrial fibrillation requiring cardioversion, CCTA may be preferred over TEE to rule out left atrial appendage or intra-cardiac thrombus.(94)
8. Heart Failure and Cardiomyopathy.
a. Incidence: In a recent report it was observed that 23% of patients with COVID-19 had presentations
consistent with heart failure. More frequently observed in patients who did not survive the hospitalization (51.9% vs 11.7%).(4) Fulminant cardiomyopathy can occur and is thought to be a late feature described in patients recovering from respiratory failure. Cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest contributes to 7-33% of deaths.(89, 95)
b. Mechanism: SARS-CoV-2 is thought to infect host cells through ACE2 to cause COVID-19, while also causing damage to the myocardium, although specific mechanisms are uncertain. (99)
c. Management: In the absence of high grade AV block or unstable bradycardia, cardiogenic shock, or acute kidney injury (AKI), guideline directed medical therapies should be continued in patients with heart failure as it can impact mortality.(100) Assessment of continuation of these therapies should be determined on a frequent basis depending on the patient’s clinical status. Assessment of continuation of these therapies should be determined on a frequent basis depending on the patient’s clinical status. The American College of Cardiology, Heart failure Society of America, American Heart association, and European Society of Cardiology have published statements at the time of this writing that recommends continuation of ACE-I/ARB therapy in patients with COVID-19.(89)
Acute Kidney Injury
1. The reported incidence of AKI with COVID-19 varies from 0.5% to 19.1%.(4, 6, 9, 10, 101, 102) This wide range is likely due to in part to the definition of AKI used and to the population studied. Rates of severe AKI requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) range from 1.4% to 9%.(9, 10) Mortality is increased in patients with AKI, a relationship that appears to be dose-dependent based on AKI severity.(102)
2. The etiology of AKI in COVID-19 is predominantly acute tubular necrosis in the setting of multi-organ failure and shock. However, there have been unpublished reports of SARS-CoV-2 being isolated from urine and observed on kidney pathology. In conjunction with evidence that hematuria and proteinuria are common findings in COVID-19, this suggests that direct viral injury to the kidney may also play a role.(102)
3. The standard of care for critically ill patients with severe AKI is continuous RRT (CRRT). The dose of CRRT is the same as that recommended for other critically ill patients: 25mL/kg/hr.(102, 103)
4. If a MTF admits a large number of patients, it is likely that there will be a shortage of CRRT supplies. If this occurs, slow low efficiency dialysis (SLED) should be considered. SLED is a hybrid therapy that utilizes standard dialysis machines.
5. Regardless of the modality of RRT used, special attention should be paid to volume status and ultrafiltration, consistent with the goals of a restrictive fluid strategy.
6. The preferred location of a dialysis catheter is the right jugular vein, followed by a femoral vein, followed by the left jugular vein.(103) The subclavian vein should be avoided.
7. Patient with COVID-19 are hypercoagulable and will likely require anticoagulants to maintain filter patency. Regional anticoagulation with citrate is preferred, however this should only be done by centers that are already familiar with the technique given the risks of hypocalcemia and citrate toxicity. Second line anti- coagulation is heparin. This topic is reviewed extensively in section 5.3 of the Kidney Disease: Improving
Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 23

Clinical Management of COVID-19
Global Outcomes Guidelines on AKI.(103) Other methods to improve filter patency are to increase blood flow (up to 400 mL/min), periodic 100mL flushes of the circuit, and pre-filter replacement fluid (if doing continuous veno-venous hemofiltration).
Hematology
1. Important pathophysiologic considerations concerning vasculature and blood in COVID-19:
a. Endothelial cells abundantly express ACE2, the principal ligand for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein.
b. SARS-CoV-2 infects and damages endothelium. The endotheliopathy caused by SARS-CoV-2 is
characterized by viral inclusions in endothelial cells, endothelial apoptosis and lymphocytic infiltration.
c. Damaged endothelium is incapable of maintaining an anticoagulant surface; microvascular and large
vessel thrombosis is common in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.
d. A recent study in ventilated ICU patients found thrombosis (PE or DVT) in 100% of patients receiving VTE
prophylaxis (LMWH) and 56% of patients receiving full anticoagulation (anticoagulation treatment
decisions made based on risk, not VTE diagnosis).
e. In severe SARS-CoV-2 infections, macrophage hyper-activation can occur and hemophagocytosis has been
observed in spleen and lung. These findings are associated with elevated levels of IL-1B and IL-6, a so-
called “cytokine storm.”
2. Key Hematologic Lab findings that may be associated with worsened prognosis in hospitalized patients:
a. Lymphopenia (60% of hospitalized patients with ALC<1000; severe depletion of CD4+ lymphocytes associated with worse prognosis; lymphocyte recovery associated with viral clearance and improving clinical course)
b. Thrombocytopenia (most patients between 100-150; lower counts with severe disease)
c. Elevated D-dimers
d. Elevated fibrinogen (typically around 500 mg/dl)
e. Prolonged prothrombin time (generally mild, 1-2 seconds beyond normal range)
f. Hypercoagulability as measured by TEG or ROTEM (shorter K or CFT, elevated MA or MCF)
g. Hyperferritinemia (400-1500 ng/ml)
h. Elevated IL-6
3. Patient Management:
a.
Hematology laboratory testing to consider for known or suspected COVID-19 cases:
i. CBC with differential (track lymphocyte count)
ii. Ferritin
iii. Type and Screen (needed if considering convalescent plasma treatment)
iv. D-dimer
v. TEG
vi. PT
vii. aPTT
viii. Fibrinogen
ix. Anti-Xa activity
Anticoagulation considerations: (adapted from Washington University – St. Louis practice guidelines)
i. All admitted patients should receive at a minimum VTE chemoprophylaxis (enoxaparin 40 mg sc daily). If possible, check anti-Xa daily 4hrs after third dose with goal 0.3-0.5. If at goal, no need to re- check; if not, adjust dose and monitor until at goal.
ii. In patients at higher risk of VTE or with more severe COVID-19 disease (evidence of coagulopathy with elevated D-dimers, prolonged PT, elevated fibrinogen, TEG hypercoagulability; intubated, proned and persistently hypoxic; MOF; requiring CVVH), it is reasonable to consider therapeutic anticoagulation or higher dose prophylaxis (e.g., enoxaparin 30 mg sc q12 hrs – “trauma dose” -- or enoxaparin 40 mg sc q12 hrs for patients with BMI>40).
iii. Persistent hypoxia should prompt evaluation for PE.
iv. VTE treatment (therapeutic anticoagulation) with enoxaparin should target anti-Xa of 0.6-1.0.
Anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin should target anti-Xa of 0.3-0.7 (see dosing table).
b.
 Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 24

Clinical Management of COVID-19
v. Strongly consider discharge prophylaxis for patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 not diagnosed with VTE (e.g., Apixaban 2.5 mg po q12 hrs for 30 days or Rivaroxaban 10mg PO q24 hours 30 days
c. Appendix I is a Weight-based Heparin Dosing Algorithm for venous thromboembolism
Nutrition
1. Nutrition care decisions are based on the patients’ clinical presentation and the need to limit healthcare provider’s exposure to patients, minimize contamination of equipment, and avoid transport.
2. Oral and enteral routes of nutrition are preferred. See Appendix J for Enteral Nutrition Pathway.
3. Ensure patients deficient in Vitamin D and Zinc are properly supplemented.(104-113)
4. Ensure patients get adequate amount of Vitamin A and Vitamin C either in their diet or other route of
nutritional support.(114, 115)
5. Enteral Nutrition (EN) for COVID-19 Patients:
a. Consult a Registered Dietitian locally or via virtual health
b. Give early enteral nutrition (ideally within the first 24-36 hours of admission or within 12 hours of
intubation), including patients on ECMO
c. Prefer gastric feeding for ease of placement and potential to use an existing NGT or OGT
d. Energy supply should target 15-20 kcal/kg actual body weight; target protein content is 1.2-2.0 g/kg daily.
e. Choose an nutrition formula based on facility availability and patient’s medical presentation:
https://www.nutritioncare.org/Guidelines_and_Clinical_Resources/EN_Formula_Guide/EN_Adult_Formulas/
f. Note: A standard high-protein (>20% protein) polymeric isosmotic enteral formula is recommended pending no renal insufficiency and normal GI function
g. Assess for risk of malnutrition/refeeding syndrome; if present, start at 25% of caloric goal (monitor serum phosphate, magnesium & potassium)
h. Continuous infusion is recommended; start nutrition at a slow rate (10ml-20ml/hr) and advance to goal as tolerated (ideally within 3-7 days of initiation)
i. If patient is to be placed in the prone position, raise HOB 10-25%. Patients in prone position generally tolerate gastric feedings
j. Monitor fluid intake closely
k. Consider medications that provide calories and adjust tube feeding rate as needed: Propofol (1.1kcal/ml);
Dextrose (3.4kcal/ml); Glycerol (4.3kcal/ml)
l. Labs: monitor electrolyes and glucose closely and triglycerides if patient is on propofol.
m. See The American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition’s (ASPEN) Resources for Clinicians Caring for
Patients with Coronavirus:(116)
https://www.nutritioncare.org/Guidelines_and_Clinical_Resources/Resources_for_Clinicians_Caring_for_Patients_with_Coronavirus/
6. If unable to initiate EN due to failed EN trial with appropriate gastric tube placement, use of prokinetic agent, and/or post-pyloric tube placement, or EN is contraindicated (ileus, SBO, Mesenteric ischemia, high pressure respiratory pressure etc.), consult Registered Dietitian locally or via virtual health immediately for possible parenteral nutrition (PN) initiation. For patients with COVID-19, the threshold to utilize PN may be lower than other critically ill patients.

 Give early enteral nutrition (within 24–48 hours of admission)
 Administer histamine-2 receptor blockers or proton-pump inhibitors in patients with risk factors for GI
bleeding. Risk factors for GI bleeding include mechanical ventilation for ≥ 48 hours, coagulopathy, renal
replacement therapy, liver disease, multiple comorbidities, and higher organ failure score  Actively mobilize the patient early in the course of illness when safe to do so
           MANAGEMENT OF CRITICAL ILLNESS AND COVID-19: SEPTIC SHOCK & CARDIAC ARREST
Recognition of Septic Shock.
1. Recognize septic shock in adults when infection is suspected or confirmed AND vasopressors are needed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) 60-65 mmHg despite adequate fluid resuscitation.(61, 117)
2. Recognize septic shock in children with any hypotension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] < 5th percentile or > 2 SD below normal for age) or two or more of the following: altered mental state; bradycardia or tachycardia (HR < 90 bpm or > 160 bpm in infants and HR < 70 bpm or > 150 bpm in children); prolonged capillary refill (> 2 sec) or feeble pulses; tachypnea; mottled or cold skin or petechial or purpuric rash; increased lactate; oliguria; hyperthermia or hypothermia.
3. Standard care includes early recognition and the following treatments within 1 hour of recognition: antimicrobial therapy, and initiation of fluid bolus and vasopressors for hypotension (Surviving Sepsis Guidelines). The use of central venous and arterial catheters should be based on resource availability and individual patient needs. Detailed guidelines from the Surviving Sepsis Campaign and WHO are available for the management of septic shock in adults and children.
4. Due to physiologic changes in pregnancy, standard risk scoring systems are less predictive for sepsis in pregnancy, although the Modified Early Obstetric Warning Score (MEOWS) has a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 79% in predicting morbidity in the obstetric population.(118, 119)
Septic Shock Resuscitation.
1. For septic shock in adults: give 250–500 mL crystalloid fluid as rapid bolus in first 15–30 minutes and reassess for signs of fluid overload after each bolus.(117)
2. For septic shock in children, give 10–20 mL/kg crystalloid fluid as a bolus as quickly as possible using a manual push and reassess for signs of fluid response after each bolus.(120)
3. Avoid Excessive Fluid Resuscitation. The cause of death from COVID-19 is most often ARDS and subsequent complications, which may be exacerbated by fluid administration. (2) Patients usually present with normal lactate and blood pressure, but some patients do suffer from superimposed bacterial septic shock. Conservative fluid therapy consistent with FACTT trial should be considered for patients with evidence of hypoperfusion and a without a history suggestive of hypovolemia (e.g. prolonged vomiting and diarrhea).(121) Consider use of POCUS to guide fluid resuscitation and prevent volume overload. If there is no response to fluid loading or signs of volume overload appear (e.g. jugular venous distension, crackles on lung auscultation, pulmonary edema on imaging, or hepatomegaly in children), then reduce or discontinue fluid administration. Clinical trials conducted in resource-limited studies comparing aggressive versus conservative fluid regimens suggest higher mortality in patients treated with aggressive fluid regimens.
4. Resuscitation endpoints include perfusion targets (e.g., MAP 60-65 mmHg in adults; urine output > 0.5 mL/kg/hr in adults or 1 mL/kg/hr in children; normalization of capillary refill; improved level of consciousness; and clearance of lactate).
5. In pregnant women, (>18 weeks gestation or when the uterus reaches the umbilicus) compression of the
Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 26
  
Clinical Management of COVID-19
inferior vena cava can cause a decrease in venous return and cardiac preload and may result in hypotension and hypoperfusion. For this reason, pregnant women with sepsis and or septic shock should be placed in the left lateral decubitus position at 30 degrees to off-load the inferior vena cava. Respiratory failure and sepsis are managed similarly to non-pregnant adults.
6. Do not use hypotonic crystalloids, starches, or gelatins for resuscitation.
7. Vasopressors should be administered when shock persists during or after fluid resuscitation to maintain
MAP goal 60-65 mmHg.
8. If central venous catheters are not available, vasopressors can be given through a peripheral IV, but use a
large vein and closely monitor for signs of extravasation and local tissue necrosis. If extravasation occurs, stop infusion, aspirate as much as possible, and consider subcutaneous phentolamine. Vasopressors can also be administered through intraosseous needles.
9. If signs of poor perfusion and cardiac dysfunction persist despite achieving MAP target with fluids and vasopressors, consider an inotrope such as dobutamine.
10. Norepinephrine is considered first-line treatment in adult patients; epinephrine or vasopressin can be added to achieve the MAP target. Vasopressors are safe in pregnancy and MAP goal is >65 mmHg.
11. Intravenous hydrocortisone (200-300 mg total daily dose, administered in divided doses every 6-8 hours or as a continuous infusion after a 50-100 mg loading dose) is recommended for patients with persistent hypotension despite the use of two or more vasopressor agents.
12. Angiotensin II (Giapreza) is a vasopressor that may provide benefit in vasodilatory refractory shock as a third-line or fourth-line agent.
13. In children, epinephrine is considered the first-line vasopressor, while norepinephrine can be added if shock persists despite optimal dose of epinephrine.

Each institution should consider, based
 Closed chest massage and Bag Mask Ventilation are extremely aerosolizing.
 Appendix K provides an example protocol, which was adapted at Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC).
1. The American Heart Association (AHA), in collaboration with multiple medical specialty societies, released interim guidance that was published in Circulation on 09 Apr 2020 to help rescuers treat victims of cardiac arrest with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Current cardiopulmonary (CPR) recommendations were reviewed in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this context, the delicate balance is to provide timely and high-quality resuscitation to patients while simultaneously protecting rescuers.(98)
2. The AHA Interim Guidance should be used to develop local “Protected Code Blue” and “Protected Rapid Response Team (RRT)” Protocols for medical emergencies that involve the resuscitation or clinical deterioration of COVID-19 suspected or confirmed patients. These policies and protocols should be peer- reviewed and based on the best available data and evidence, and should also be updated based on performance improvement data and experience. Refer to Appendix L for AHA ACLS and PALS protocols.
3. Protecting healthcare personnel (HCP) is a major priority in medical emergencies for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. Although medical emergencies are time-sensitive situations, donning the appropriate PPE is extremely important as unintentional HCP exposure can result in detrimental effects to the workforce. Central strategies to protect HCPs during a medical emergency include efficient placement of appropriate PPE outside a patient’s room, minimizing personnel in the room, and regular training.
4. Regular training should focus on the expectations, roles, and responsibilities for the individual participants in
these medical emergency events, as outlined in Appendix K. Mock simulated scenarios should be regularly
used to practice these clinical situations. Here are some hyperlinked video examples from Brooke Army
Medical Center of simulated scenarios with a COVID-19 RRT and COVID-19 Code Blue.

5. For activation of a RRT or Code Blue on a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patient, the following are recommended:
    Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 27
on patients who don't have a known recent
 highly-reliable negative PCR should be performed with full PPE and treated as a suspected COVID-19 patient.

Clinical Management of COVID-19
a. Donning of enhanced PPE in an expeditious fashion should be performed with a PPE Buddy to confirm the appropriate infection control procedures.
b. Consider having PPE readily available for rescuers, such as having a "go bag" or have it positioned on each ward or in the immediate vicinity of the crash cart.
c. Entry to a patient’s room during a RRT or Code Blue should be minimized to essential personnel.
d. The patient should be assessed by the most senior medical staff available to determine appropriate
management and disposition, unless deferred by the responsible staff.
e. If a patient starts to decompensate or is found unresponsive, the initial responder should prioritize the
placement of a closely available surgical mask on the patient.
f. Chest compressions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is aerosol generating. Before commencing
CPR, all medical personnel should wear airborne PPE, including PAPR if able. If available, an automated
compressor device should be used to minimize personnel and exposure.
g. Appropriate equipment and supplies (viral filter, video laryngoscope, etc) should be prepositioned in the
vicinity of the crash cart on COVID-19 ICUs and/or wards. Depending on local availability of resources, consider modifying the protocol for bringing the entire crash cart into the room. Due to the high risk of aerosol generation that occur during these clinical events, attempts should be made to minimize the degree and amount of door opening that occurs.
h. If not intubated, a non-rebreather mask should immediately be placed on the patient for passive oxygenation. NOTE: ensure continuous oxygen delivery is temporarily removed for defibrillation to avoid airway fire. Depending on local protocol, a bag-valve mask (BVM) with a viral filter may be considered if using a two-person technique to ensure a tight seal.
i. Use intubator with highest likelihood of first pass success. Chest compressions should be paused for intubation, and ideally timed with a pulse and rhythm check. Video laryngoscopy recommended to reduce direct exposure to generated aerosols from direct laryngoscopy; however, the intubator should use the technique with which she/he is most likely to have first-pass success.
j. Minimize closed-circuit disconnection. If the patient is connected to a ventilator, attempt to remain connected and adjust the settings to replicate the bag-valve mask delivery of oxygen, unless airway obstruction or ventilator malfunction is suspected. Consider adjusting the set respiratory rate to 10 breaths per minute during CPR. Alternatively, or if it is felt that the patient is not getting adequate ventilation through the ventilator, the ETT can be clamped and the patient can be disconnected from the ventilator and connected to a bag at which point the ETT can be unclamped for traditional bag ventilation.
k. Focus on potentially reversible conditions (H’s and T’s): DOPE (Displacement of breathing tube, Obstruction, Pneumothorax, Equipment failure) mnemonic for sudden hypoxia, and identification and treatment of shockable rhythm. Consider use of portable ultrasound and obtain a blood gas.
l. Avoid prolonged codes in patients with cardiac arrest. Consider discontinuation after 20 minutes.
6. The following table identifies best practices based on a “Minimum, Better, Best” model, as the COVID-19
outbreak could ultimately result in limited resources based on observational data from other countries. The goal is to achieve all elements of each category, as “Good” equates with the minimum standard-of-care while “Best” equates with the most ideal condition.

    1. If COVID-19 is widespread in the community, surgical masks should be considered for ALL patients irrespective of COVID-19 status.
2. The movement of patients with COVID-19 should be limited with all efforts made to ensure the patient is initially admitted to the appropriate location.
3. If patient transport is necessary:
a. Non-intubated patients should be transferred wearing a surgical mask over their oxygen delivery device
which may include nasal prongs or a non-rebreather mask up to 15 L/min.
b. Staff should wear airborne PPE.
c. Once a patient is admitted to the ICU, transport outside of the ICU should be limited. If transport is
required, then coordination should occur to ensure safety standards are maintained.
d. Hallways must be cleared where possible and only essential staff should accompany the patient. Staff not
involved in the transfer should not come within 6 feet of the patient.
e. Intubated patients should have closed circuits with a viral filter in situ and cuff pressure should be
maintained to avoid air leaks.
IMAGING OF COVID-19: RADIOLOGY DEPARTMENT GUIDANCE & IMAGING FINDINGS
Imaging findings have been widely reported in the context of COVID-19 but local policies for when and how to use imaging are widely variable and must take into consideration many site-specific, regional and organizational factors. Imaging exams for non-COVID-19 patients will be impacted as facilities work to limit avoidable exposures for patients and healthcare workers. The American College of Radiology (ACR) has consolidated generalizable guidance for imaging department workflow, COVID-19 imaging findings and standardized reporting on its “ACR COVID-19 Clinical Resources for Radiologists” page which is updated regularly.(122)
Radiology Department Guidance for Rescheduling Exams.
1. The ACR fully supports CDC guidance advising medical facilities to “reschedule non-urgent outpatient visits.” These include but are not limited to the following imaging procedures: (122)
• Screening mammography (123-126)
• Lung cancer screening Computed Tomography (CT)
• Non-urgent radiography, fluoroscopy, CT, US, and MRI exams
  Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 29

Clinical Management of COVID-19
• Non-urgent or elective image-guided procedures
2. If rescheduling exams, Radiology departments should work directly with referring providers to ensure only
non-urgent studies are delayed. All other imaging exams should continue as scheduled or be accelerated in order to expedite necessary imaging prior to local/regional incidence of COVID-19 increases with a corresponding influx of COVID-19 patients expected to occupy more healthcare resources.
Use of Imaging for COVID-19
1. Whether to image a patient suspected of having COVID-19 or diagnosed with COVID-19 depends on multiple factors including clinical symptoms, pre-test probability, potential for imaging results to alter management, and local resource availability. Various guidelines on imaging indications continue to be published regularly.
• The ACR, Society for Thoracic Radiology (STR) and the American Society of Emergency Radiology (ASER) recommend that CT should not be used to screen or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID- 19. (127)
• Imaging should be reserved for cases where it will impact management or in order to evaluate for urgent/emergent alternative diagnoses. (128)
• Multinational consensus statement from the Fleischner Society on the role of chest imaging (CXR and CT) for COVID-19 was published 7 April 2020 and provides specific imaging recommendations based on three clinical scenarios: 1) patients presenting with mild features of COVID-19, 2) moderate-severe features of COVID-19 and 3) moderate-severe features of COVID-19 in a resource constrained environment.(129)
2. The reported sensitivity of Chest CT for COVID-19 ranges from 80-90% and the reported specificity ranges from 60-70%. (130, 131)
• A normal chest CT does not mean a patient does not have COVID-19; a normal imaging study should not keep a patient from being quarantined if they meet other clinical criteria.
• An abnormal CT is not specific for COVID-19 and it does not obviate the need for confirmatory laboratory testing. (132)
3. There is accumulating evidence of thromboembolic complications of COVID-19. In the event of acute clinical deterioration with suspected pulmonary embolism and/or elevated D-dimer levels, CT pulmonary angiography should be considered. The National Institute for Public Health of the Netherlands recently published recommendations for imaging for pulmonary embolism or deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in COVID-19 patients.(133)
4. ACR recommends minimizing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) use except where absolutely necessary. (ACR guidance on COVID-19 and MR use, https://www.acr.org/Clinical-Resources/Radiology-Safety/MR- Safety/COVID-19-and-MR-Use)
5. Infection control and PPE: When imaging is performed on patients who are positive or suspected positive for COVID-19, consider implementing the following infection control precautions. (128)
• Portable imaging is preferred when possible, preferably using a portable x-ray machine dedicated for imaging COVID-19 suspected/positive patients [N.B. when possible, similar designation of other radiology equipment (e.g. ultrasound, CT and MRI) specifically for imaging COVID-19 suspected/positive patients should be made to limit cross contamination.
• Imaging should be performed nearest to the patient location to minimize exposure
• Droplet precautions should be employed for all patients who are positive or suspected positive for
COVID-19. Patients should be masked throughout the imaging exam and deep cleaning of all
surfaces is performed afterward by someone wearing proper PPE.
• Airborne precautions are reserved for patients undergoing aerosol-generating procedures
(bronchoscopy, intubation, nebulization, or open suction).
• Healthcare providers (technologist, nurse, etc.) should wear appropriate PPE (gloves, mask, eye-
shield and possibly gown depending on the possibility of close or direct contact with the patient)
• Record a census of other patients and staff present at the time of the patient visit, should the
patient later test positive for COVID-19
6. When performing image-guided procedures on patients who are positive or suspected positive for COVID-19,
consider implementing the following infection control precautions: (134)
  Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 30

Clinical Management of COVID-19
• Store all PPE in secure locations with limited access, implement inventory controls, and clearly define PPE to be used based on patient status.
• Identify a dedicated room to perform procedures on PUIs and COVID-19-positive patients. An air- negative room is strongly recommended if available.
• Empty rooms designated for procedures on COVID-19-suspected/confirmed patients of all non- essential equipment and supplies to avoid contamination.
• Create a staffing plan designed to preserve physician and staff availability if individuals become exposed and sick. Consider backup teams.
• Minimize staff in the procedure room.
• Develop clear plans for removing and disposing contaminated PPE.
• Have a clear exit plan for COVID-19-suspected/confirmed patients to minimize staff exposure.
• Ensure staff scrubs are changed and lead aprons are cleaned with EPA-approved disinfectants.
Imaging Findings of COVID-19 on Chest Radiographs
1. If imaging is part of a pre-hospital assessment of COVID-19 positive or PUI patients, portable x-ray is preferred (preferably using a dedicated portable x-ray machine to limit cross contamination).
2. In one study of 64 patients, baseline chest radiograph (CXR) had a sensitivity of 69%. (135)
3. Bilateral consolidation and ground glass opacities were the most common findings (59% and 41%,
respectively) in a peripheral and lower lung distribution (51% and 63% respectively).
4. Severity of CXR findings peak at 10-12 days from date of symptom onset. (135)
Imaging Findings of COVID-19 on Chest Computed Tomography (CT).
1. CT findings of COVID-19 overlap with findings of other viral pneumonias.
2. CT findings of COVID-19: (130, 136-139)
• Extent - bilateral, multi-lobar
• Distribution – peripheral and basilar or random
• Characterization – rounded or peripheral ground glass opacities (GGO) without or with septal
thickening (“crazy paving” pattern), consolidation, central low attenuation (reverse halo sign of
organizing pneumonia)
3. Lymphadenopathy, pleural effusions and a nodular pattern are not common.
4. CT finding severity peak from 6-11 days after symptom onset. (140, 141)
5. Standardized reporting guidelines were developed and endorsed by the Radiological Society of North
America (RSNA), the Society of Thoracic Radiology and the American College of Radiology. (142)
• Consultation with clinical colleagues at each institution is suggested to establish a mutual approach.
• If features of COVID-19 are discovered incidentally on exams performed for other indications,
contact referring providers to discuss the possibility of viral infection and consider using the more general term “viral pneumonia” in the differential diagnosis. However, if after discussion COVID-19 is felt to be likely, then the authors suggest using one of the four structured reporting categories listed below.
6. Structured reporting categories for COVID-19 on chest CT.
• Typical appearance
1. Findings: Peripheral, bilateral GGO with or without consolidation or visible septal lines (“crazy paving”); multifocal rounded GGO; reverse halo sign or other signs of organizing pneumonia (later in disease).
2. Suggested reporting language: “Commonly reported imaging features of COVID-19 pneumonia are present. Other processes such as influenza pneumonia and organizing pneumonia, as can be seen with drug toxicity and connective tissue disease, can cause a similar imaging pattern.”
• Indeterminate appearance
1. Findings: Absent typical features AND multifocal, diffuse, peri-hilar or unilateral GGO
with or without consolidation lacking a specific distribution; lacking a rounded or peripheral characterization; few very small GGO non-rounded and non-peripheral.

2. Suggested reporting language: “Imaging features can be seen with COVID-19 pneumonia, though are nonspecific and can occur with a variety of infectious and noninfectious processes.”
Atypical appearance
1. Findings: Absent typical or indeterminate features AND isolated lobar or segmental
consolidation without GGO, discrete small nodules (centrilobular or “tree-in-bud”), lung
cavitation, smooth interlobular septal thickening with pleural effusion.
2. Suggested reporting language: “Imaging features atypical or uncommonly reported for
COVID-19 pneumonia. Alternative diagnoses should be considered.”
Negative for pneumonia
1. Findings: No CT features to suggest pneumonia.
2. Suggested reporting language: “No CT findings present to indicate pneumonia. (Note: CT
may be negative in the early stages of COVID-19.)”
 ADJUNCTIVE THERAPIES FOR COVID-19: TREATMENT PROTOCOLS
NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines are available at: http://covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/
These evidence-based recommendations focused on medical therapies are complementary to the PMG, and like it are intended to be updated regularly in response to emerging evidence.
Summary of treatment recommendations according to patient’s disease status, as of 24 April 2020:
 For uninfected persons and for asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic people with infection – No agents are
recommended for use outside a trial
 For those with mild; moderate; severe; or critical illness – There are insufficient data to recommend for
or against any antiviral or immunomodulatory therapy Recommendations on select specific agents:
 Insufficient data to recommend for or against the use of: chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, plasma / hyperimmune immunoglobulin, IL-6 / IL-1 inhibitors.
 Recommend against the use of: hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, other immunomodulators, except in a clinical trial.
Note: All therapies are investigational and none are proven as the literature is evolving quickly. No FDA unapproved medications should be routinely recommended for use outside of a clinical trial. There is no evidence for use of the following medications for outpatients or mildly ill patients. The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) website has a number of regularly updated resources at: https://www.ashp.org/Pharmacy- Practice/Resource-Centers/Coronavirus.
Ethics of Clinical Research during a Pandemic: There is genuine uncertainty in the expert medical community over whether proposed off-label and investigational treatments are beneficial. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials (RCT) are the gold standard for determining if an experimental treatment can benefit patients. Some may question whether it is ethical to deprive patients of an agent that could potentially prevent or treat COVID-19, given the high mortality rate among critically ill patients and lack of known and available treatment options. A Committee of National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine reviewed and conducted an analysis of the clinical trials conducted during the 2014–2015 Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa and found the that the RCT was an ethical and appropriate design to use, even in the context of the Ebola epidemic. The position of “equipoise”—genuine uncertainty in the expert medical community over whether a treatment will be beneficial—“is the ethical basis for assigning only some participants to receive the agent. If the relative risks and benefits of an agent are unknown, participants who receive the experimental agent may receive a benefit or may be made worse off. Providing the experimental agent to all would expose all participants to potentially harmful effects.” (143)
     Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 32

Clinical Management of COVID-19
Steroids.
1. There is a strong consideration to avoid routine steroids.(144)
2. However, new consensus guidelines recommend considering methylprednisolone for intubated COVID-19
patients with ARDS.(61, 145)
3. Steroids may be indicated for vasopressor-refractory shock, asthma, COPD exacerbation, or for antenatal
therapy at risk for preterm birth from 24-34 weeks of gestation (see Pregnancy Section).
Remdesivir.
1. Remdesivir is an investigational intravenous drug with broad activity against RNA viruses that inhibits replication through premature termination of RNA transcription. Remdesivir has in vitro activity against SARS- CoV-2 and in vitro and in vivo activity against related beta-coronaviruses. It has shown promise in vitro and in animal models for coronavirus infections.(146-148)
2. Data from uncontrolled compassionate use case reports has suggested potential benefit; safety and efficacy data from RCTs conducted in China found that remdesivir use was not associated with the primary endpoint, a difference in time to clinical improvement. A statistically non-significant faster time to clinical improvement compared to placebo was seen among patients with symptom duration of 10 days or less; however, this study was terminated early due to low enrollment, and may have been underpowered.(149) Preliminary data from the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT) led by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04280705) indicate that patients who received remdesivir had a significantly faster time to recovery compared to placebo (11 days versus 15 days, p<0.001) with a trend towards improved survival.(150) In the SIMPLE trial, a Gilead-sponsored Phase 3 randomized open-label trial of remdesivir comparing 5 days to 10 days of therapy for severely ill patients not on mechanical ventilation, the company reported that the two regimens did not appear to differ in terms of efficacy (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04292899). Neither ACTT or Save been published or undergone formal peer review at the time of this writing.
3. Exclusion criteria in the RCTs included increased ALT or AST levels (>5 times the upper limit of normal) and impaired creatinine clearance (CrCl<30), which clinicians should consider regarding applicability of the preliminary findings to the care of individual patients.
4. On 01 May 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the use of remdesivir. At this time, access to remdesivir under the EUA remains limited and will be directed towards regions with the highest burdens of COVID-19, under the direction of the federal government for now. Within the MHS, the USAMMDA Force Health Protection Division has established an expanded access program (“Intermediate-Size Patient Population Expanded Access Protocol for Treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) with Remdesivir”). This program has a limited number of treatment courses of remdesivir for active duty service members both within CONUS and OCONUS, as well as for federal civilian and contract employees deployed OCONUS while in support of operational forces. There may be limited availability of remdesivir for other MHS beneficiaries (e.g., retirees, dependents), which may be reviewed with USAMMDA. Access to the protocol requires a site investigational new drug (IND) submission to USAMMDA for patients meeting inclusion criteria. Clinicians can contact USAMMDA FHP Division to determine eligibility to receive product using their 24-hour international telephone: +1-301-401-2768.
Chloroquine (CQ) and Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ).
1. FDA gave Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for use in COVID-19 patients on 28 Mar 2020:
https://www.fda.gov/media/136534/download
2. However, on 24 April FDA “cautions against use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for COVID-19 outside of the hospital setting or a clinical trial due to risk of heart rhythm problems; close supervision is strongly recommended.“ (151)
3. These drugs have been used as anti-malarial prophylaxis and to treat autoimmune conditions.
4. BLUF: No high-quality evidence exists to support use at present. Potential toxicities include QTc prolongation,
risk for arrhythmias, and retinal pigmentation and vision loss.
5. Early reports from France that treatment with HCQ alone and HCQ + azithromycin were associated with marked
reduction in time to clearance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA have not been substantiated in a subsequent report.(152,
   Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 33

Clinical Management of COVID-19
153)
6. In a trial comparing “high dose” with “low dose” chloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 in Brazil, enrollment in
the high dose arm was terminated early on the recommendation of the trial Data and Safety Monitoring Board
due to concerns of toxicity and increased mortality.(154)
7. Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine are associated with QTc prolongation. Prior to initiation of therapy a 12 lead
EKG should be performed. Consider alternative therapy in subjects with known Long QT syndrome; discontinue combination with other QT prolonging drugs if QTC >500msec (or >530-550msec if QRS >120msec).(152, 155)
8. Several clinical trials have been initiated/are planned to study CQ/HCQ for treating or preventing COVID-19.
Lopinavir/Ritonavir.
1. Coronavirus cellular infectivity and replication are dependent on virally-encoded and cellular protease activity. Clinically used protease inhibitors effective for HIV and HCV infection have been examined for potential utility in treatment of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, but are currently not recommended.
2. On 18 March 2020, RCT results were reported that found no benefit in patients who received lopinavir/ritonavir compared to standard care for treatment of severe disease.(156-158)
3. Do not use in combination with amiodarone (fatal arrhythmia), quetiapine (severe coma), or simvastatin (rhabdomyolysis).
Host-directed anti-inflammatory strategies. ARDS and sepsis, life-threatening downstream complications of COVID- 19, and many other infectious and non-infectious conditions, remain significant unmet therapeutic gaps. Historically, numerous anti-inflammatory and anti-cytokine agents, as well as many other drug candidates, have been tested and failed to meaningfully affect morbidity and mortality in ARDS, sepsis and/or septic shock.
Anti-IL6 monoclonal antibodies.
1. A variety of therapies are being administered to severely ill patients in China and elsewhere. One that is receiving substantial attention currently is an anti-IL6 receptor humanized monoclonal antibody, tocilizumab (Actemra®), which was added to the treatment guidelines published by China’s National Health Commission (4 Mar 20) to treat serious coronavirus patients with lung damage.
2. Tocilizumab and sarilumab are licensed in US for treatment of giant cell arteritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and cytokine release syndrome following CAR-T therapy. They carry a black box warning for risk of severe, potentially fatal, infections.
3. No high-quality evidence currently exists to support use. Some reports from China have suggested elevated IL6 levels are associated with severe disease in COVID-19 infection, though other reports have not found the same association. Tocilizumab has been used in Italy according to anecdotal reports and an unpublished uncontrolled case series from China treated 21 hypoxemic patients with tocilizumab 400 mg IV x1 and reported improvement in respiratory parameters.(159, 160)
4. Manufacturer-supported US randomized controlled trials of tocilizumab and sarilumab are planned.
Convalescent Plasma.
1. Convalescent plasma from patients who have recovered from SARS CoV-2 infection has been proposed as a potential therapy for patients with severe COVID-19.(161) In an uncontrolled case series in China, 5 patients were given plasma from patients that had recovered from COVID-19 with improvement in clinical status.(162) No data from controlled trials suggest benefit for COVID or other coronavirus infections. A Phase 2 and a subsequent Phase 3 RCT of convalescent plasma for influenza A did not show clinical benefit.(163, 164) Convalescent plasma treatment carries known risks of transfusion-associated acute lung injury (TRALI) and transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO), and theoretical risk in the setting of coronavirus disease of possible “immune-enhanced pathology.”
2. As of 3 April, the FDA has authorized the use of convalescent plasma to treat “serious or life threatening” COVID-19 disease under Investigational New Drug (IND) protocols.(165) Requests may be made by email and there is a number to call for expedited use. The following website provides instructions for requests: https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/investigational-new-drug-ind-or-device-exemption-ide- process-cber/investigational-covid-19-convalescent-plasma-emergency-inds

Clinical Management of COVID-19
a. Severe disease is defined by the FDA as follows: dyspnea, RR>30 breaths/min, SpO2 <93% on RA, PaO2:FiO2 ratio of <300, or increases in lung infiltrations by >50% within 24-48 hours.
b. Life threatening disease is defined by the FDA as follows: respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ dysfunction or failure.
3. DASD (HRP&O), DHA, and R2O2 coordinated with Mayo Clinic to establish a process by which DoD Military Treatment Facilities (MTF) can participate in Mayo’s Expanded Access Program (EAP) compliant with DoD requirements and simultaneously adheres to the procedures established by the Mayo Clinic for all participating sites.
4. A DOD EAP for convalescent plasma sponsored by Army OTSG and executed through USAMMDA FHP Division is in process as of 27 April, and is still in process as of 13 May.
Several additional agents are under investigation and information is expected to emerge rapidly. Discernment of benefits and harms from novel therapies will require diligent attention to quality of evidence reported.
CARING FOR SPECIAL POPULATIONS: Pregnancy and Lactation, Infants, Children, and the Elderly
OVERVIEW
- It is not currently known if pregnant people have a greater chance of getting sick from COVID-19 than the general public, nor whether they are more likely to have serious illness as a result. Based on available information, pregnant people seem to have the same risk as adults who are not pregnant.
- Healthcare providers should be aware of the physiologic changes associated with pregnancy. Pregnant people have changes in their bodies that may increase their risk of some infections. Pregnant people have had a higher risk of severe illness when infected with viruses from the same family as COVID-19 and other viral respiratory infections, such as influenza.
- Healthcare providers treating pregnant women should be aware of the most current guidance on Pregnancy/ Lactation guidance as prescribed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM), among others.
- Visitors are limited to one (healthy) support person during the entire admission.
- Cross-collaboration with surgical services healthcare providers and communities and pediatric and neonatal
healthcare providers and communities is essential to ensuring positive outcomes.
Caring for Pregnant Women during the COVID-19 Pandemic
1. Based on limited data, pregnant women do not appear to be at higher risk for severe disease. Emerging reports from the United States suggest that pregnant women may be at higher risk of being an asymptomatic carrier and having an atypical presentation with severe respiratory morbidity and preterm labor.(16-19) Clinical findings in reported cases were similar in cases of non-pregnant adults. Pregnant women experience immunologic and physiologic changes that make them more susceptible to viral respiratory infections.(17) Pregnant women are at greater risk for severe illness, morbidity, or mortality compared with the general population, as is observed with other related coronavirus infections.(18, 19) Pregnant women should receive the same care as those not pregnant in regards to screening, radiology studies, laboratory evaluations and critical care.
2. Pregnancy complications: Pregnancy in the setting of a COVID-19 infection is associated with higher rates of miscarriage (39.1%), preterm birth less than 37 weeks (24.3%), preeclampsia (16.2%), cesarean delivery (84%), increased incidence of neonatal admission (57.2%) and perinatal death (11.1%) Some cases of preterm birth were iatrogenic and not due to spontaneous preterm labor. (17, 18)
3. Pregnancy care should be considered non-elective during the COVID-19 pandemic.
4. Providers are encouraged to encourage patient enrollment of pregnant patients confirmed with COVID-19 in
the Pregnancy Coronavirus Outcomes Registry (PRIORITY) (https://priority.ucsf.edu/).
5. Health care providers should be familiar with the physiologic changes of pregnancy that make pregnant
women more susceptible to some respiratory infections.
a. Immune modulation of pregnancy
   Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 35

Clinical Management of COVID-19
b. c.
Pregnant women are more susceptible to respiratory failure and can decompensate quickly (especially in the third trimester) due to 20% decrease in functional residual capacity.
Respiratory changes: Pregnancy is a metabolically compensated respiratory alkalosis
i. Normal pregnancy ABG pH 7.4-7.47
ii. Normal pregnancy PaO2 75-106 mm Hg (PaO2 increases by 30 mm Hg)
iii. Normal pregnancy PaCO2 26-32 mm Hg (PaCO2 decreases by 30 mmHg)
iv. Normal pregnancy HCO3 18-21 d.
 e.
Critical care considerations for pregnant women; online training available at
https://www.smfm.org/critical-care/cases/new-2019
A PaCO2 of 35 to 45 is ABNORMAL in pregnancy, and signifies impaired ventilation and impending
 respiratory compromise.
 6. Screening Guidelines: ACOG and SMFM algorithm for outpatient assessment and management of pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19: https://www.acog.org/-/media/project/acog/acogorg/files/pdfs/clinical- guidance/practice-advisory/covid-19-algorithm.pdf?la=en&hash=2D9E7F62C97F8231561616FFDCA3B1A6
7. A system should be in place for pregnant women who are tested for COVID 19 to be reported to their OB Providers. This will allow OB providers to make critical delivery, care planning recommendations and decisions related to PPE recommendations, as all obstetric patients will require inpatient admission for delivery and initial postpartum period (1-4 days).
8. Risk of vertical transmission: Case series to date suggest no evidence of vertical transmission, similar to other viral respiratory illnesses, such as influenza.(17, 18)
9. Changes to routine OB care during COVID-19 pandemic: To decrease opportunities of exposure to coronavirus, OB providers should be taking steps to reduce patient encounters and optimize telehealth visits and home blood pressure monitoring. Guidance for practice has been published and we recommend developing plans at each MTF to standardize changes in Prenatal Care. (166)
10. Inpatient Obstetric Staffing: To ensure the availability of healthy providers and nurses to support ongoing needs of necessary care, consider workplace segregation, which will ensure service continuity and social distancing of healthcare workers, infection control and facilitate contact tracing. This is especially important for obstetric and newborn service lines which must continue to provide necessary prenatal, intrapartum and neonatal/postpartum care.
11. Care for the pregnant patient with PUI or COVID 19
a. Admission: Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be admitted to a unit capable of
caring for the respiratory needs of the patient as well as provide appropriate fetal monitoring as clinically indicated. Patient should be in isolation per hospital and CDC guidance.
i. Pregnant women should be admitted to the hospital for treatment of COVID symptoms if there is concern about respiratory status (02 requirement to maintain saturations above 92%, increased work of breathing, RR> 24 bpm), tachycardia > 110 bpm, dehydration, obstetric concerns.
b. COVID-19 may be associated with a transaminitis and thrombocytopenia, this is an important consideration when assessing women with a hypertensive disorder to determine if she has features of preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome (hemolysis elevated liver enzymes low platelet count).
c. Guidance for treatment: Aggressive infection control, testing for COVID-19, testing for co-infection, oxygen therapy as needed, avoidance of fluid overload, empiric antibiotics (due to risk of superimposed bacterial risk), fetal and uterine contraction monitoring for viable pregnancies, early mechanical ventilation for progressive respiratory failure, individualized delivery planning, Maternal Fetal Medicine (MFM) consultation, Pulmonology, Critical Care and Infectious disease involvement as indicated. Team based management is recommended. Consider early transfer to higher level facility if unable to provide services at MTF.(167)
i. Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine are well tolerated in pregnancy and human data in exposed pregnancies do not suggest harm.(168)
ii. Remdesivir is not studied in pregnancy and no human or animal data could be found. (168)
iii. Imaging:
   Necessary radiographic studies should not be withheld from a pregnant patient. Fetal
 risk of anomalies, growth restriction or abortion have not been reported with radiation

Clinical Management of COVID-19
12. Delivery:
13. Cardiac arrest: in pregnancy should be managed similar to cardiac arrest in non-pregnant adults. If pregnancy is ≥ 20 weeks (uterus at or above the umbilicus), significant aortocaval compression exists. Left uterine displacement is recommended during high-quality CPR, with resuscitative cesarean delivery (perimortem cesarean delivery) if ROSC not achieved by 4-5 minutes. Resuscitative cesarean delivery should be performed at the bedside (do not move to the OR).(169)
14. Antenatal surveillance: Gestational age appropriate fetal monitoring should be part of the initial assessment of any women with respiratory symptoms.
15. Ultrasound
the ISUOG Safety Statement: Safe performance of obstetric and gynecological scans and equipment cleaning in the context of COVID-19 (https://www.isuog.org/resource/isuog-safety-committee-position-statement- safe-performance-of-obstetric-and-gynecological-scans-and-equipment-cleaning-in-the-context-of-covid- 19.html). Appendix M has detailed instructions on preparation and cleaning of ultrasound rooms for patients.
16. Follow up after diagnosis of COVID-19: When patient is discharged from the hospital a plan for follow up should be established. Recommend follow up with patients via phone or video telehealth assessments 5-7 days after discharge. Return precautions should be reviewed with the patient prior to discharge If patients symptoms worsen arrangements should be made for patient to be seen in person by a health care provider to assess clinical status.
12. Antepartum Care:
a. Outpatient: Patients who do not meet criteria for admission to the hospital should be conservatively
managed at home on self-quarantine. Follow up with an OB provider can be made utilizing Telehealth services per local guidance. It is recommended that patients have a follow up with a health care provider 5-7 days after initial presentation to evaluate for resolution of symptoms (may be via telehealth).
b. Inpatient: Pregnant women should be admitted to the hospital for treatment of COVID-19 symptoms if there is concern about respiratory status (O2 requirement to maintain saturations above 92%, increased work of breathing, RR> 24 breaths per minute), tachycardia > 110 bpm, dehydration, obstetric concerns.
13. Intrapartum Care:
a. Screen all patients and support person(s) according to ACOG SMFM algorithm upon presentation to L&D.
b. We also suggest asking all patients and support person(s) about exposures (close contact) to COVID
positive patients and if they themselves have been tested in the past 14 days for COVID-19.
c. Recommend a designated staff member at the front of the unit to verbally screen for URI symptoms,
diagnosis of COVID-19 or PUI within the past 2 weeks.
d. Any patient with fever, cough, or respiratory symptoms (+/- fever) should put on a surgical mask and be
evaluated by a nurse or provider (and put in a room).
e. If a patient screens positive to any of the above prior to a scheduled delivery (IOL or CD), evaluate to
determine if re-scheduling in 2-3 days is feasible to allow for results of COVID-19 testing
 exposure of less than 50 mGy, a level above the range of exposure for most diagnostic
 procedures.
 Timing of delivery, in most cases, should not be dictated by maternal COVID-19 infection. For
 women infected early in pregnancy who recover, no alteration to the usual timing of delivery is necessary. For
 women infected in the third trimester who recover, it is reasonable to attempt to postpone delivery (if no
 other medical indications arise) either until a negative COVID-19 testing result is obtained or quarantine status
 is lifted in an attempt to avoid transmission to the neonate. In general, COVID-19 infection itself is not an
 indication for delivery. Recommend health care team wear appropriate PPE during delivery and delivery
 should occur in a negative pressure room. Skin to skin care following delivery is not recommended. In cases of
 severe maternal infection with a term infant, care teams may consider avoiding delayed cord clamping to
 minimize the risk of transmission to the neonate.
 the pregnancy is not needed.
Continuous fetal monitoring in the setting of severe illness should
 be considered only when delivery would not compromise maternal health, or as another noninvasive
 measure of maternal status. For women who recover from an acute infection, antepartum testing later in
  consider a detailed level 2 anatomic survey for women following recovery from a first trimester
 infection and a fetal growth assessment in the third trimester for women who recover from an infection later
 in pregnancy (later second trimester and third trimester infections). Healthcare providers should be aware of
   Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 37

Clinical Management of COVID-19
f. For COVID-19 positive patients with mild or moderate symptoms not requiring immediate care, it is important to recognize that the severity of disease peaks in the second week, so planning delivery prior to that time is optimal.
g. Risk of vertical transmission – no documented evidence of vertical transmission based on limited case series
h. Avoid oxygen for fetal resuscitation (this intervention has not been shown to be beneficial and may increase the risk of aerosolization).
i. If a birth partner (support person) has a fever, cough, or respiratory symptoms (+/- fever) (or confirmed COVID-19 positive or PUI), they should not come to L&D, and will not be admitted to L&D as a support person.
j. Support persons of a COVID-19 positive or PUI mother should wear a mask during their hospital stay, and are restricted to the patient room. They are not allowed to visit hospital areas outside the patient room. They should use the bathroom in the patient room, and should have all meals brought to the room.
k. Routine preop labs for scheduled cases should be drawn the day of procedure to minimize trips to the hospital.
l. Intrapartum fever – should be evaluated in the usual fashion with consideration for both obstetric and non-obstetric causes. Recommend empiric treatment for the clinically suspected cause (e.g. chorioamnionitis), with increased vigilance and consideration of rapid COVID-19 testing, as early experience has shown the possibility of asymptomatic pregnant patients to develop symptoms postpartum.
m. Cesarean section: As for all patients, cesarean section should be reserved for maternal and fetal indications. Consider conversions of operating rooms to negative pressure rooms (conversion to negative pressure ante-rooms or neutral pressure ORs are alternatives) for COVID positive or PUI. Such conversions may not be possible in all facilities, and with proper PPE and patient transfer protocols, cesarean deliveries can still be safely performed in a positive-flow OR. In general, negative pressure ORs should not have open surgical equipment (as is often done for designated emergent cesarean delivery rooms). Teams should coordinate with local infection control teams to inform these decisions. Consider universal airborne PPE use (including N95 masks) for all surgical procedures for COVID+/PUI patients during labor and delivery due to high risk for aerosolizing procedures (intubation).
14. Support Person: If a birth partner (support person) has a fever, cough, or respiratory symptoms (+/- fever) (or confirmed COVID-19 positive or PUI), they should not come to L&D, and will not be admitted to L&D as a support person.
a. Visitors are limited to one (healthy) support person during the entire admission. (166)
b. Support persons of a COVID-19 positive or PUI mother should wear a mask during their hospital stay, and are restricted to the patient room (should not visit hospital areas outside patient room). They should use the bathroom in the patient room, and should have all meals brought to the room.
15. Inductions of Labor:
a. Induction of labor with medical indications in asymptomatic women should NOT be postponed or
rescheduled. This includes 39-week inductions after patient counseling. However, in cases of extreme healthcare burden, it may be appropriate to consider postponing or rescheduling inductions. For example, in a region early in a COVID-19 emergency, it may be prudent to get patients delivered prior to high COVID-19 burden in the hospital.
b. Consider outpatient cervical ripening with Foley in low-risk women to limit hospital time.
c. Management of the first stage of labor is not generally altered. Oral restriction of fluid and solid food in
the first stage of labor is not recommended, oral water and clear fluids can be encouraged as tolerated in labor. If oral restriction, IVF at 250 mL/hr. containing dextrose, with upright positions in the first stage of labor for women without epidural. If walking, must stay in the room. Oxytocin augmentation is recommended to shorten time in labor if slowed progress, with early amniotomy.
d. Intrapartum oxygen therapy has no fetal benefit and may cause harm, recommend NOT utilizing oxygen therapy for fetal resuscitation. Given the high rate of asymptomatic carriers, this principle applies to all patients on L&D regardless of the patient’s COVID-19 status. Supplemental oxygen may be administered
for maternal indications, cover nasal cannula with a surgical mask.
Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 38

Clinical Management of COVID-19
16. Second Stage (Pushing to delivery): Pushing should not be delayed for any delivery as it prolongs time to delivery and increases chorioamnionitis and postpartum hemorrhage.
17. Third Stage (Delivery of baby to delivery of placenta): There are concerns about limited blood resources during the COVID-19 pandemic. The below recommendations apply to all deliveries to further minimize use of blood products at delivery.
a. Recommend optimizing antenatal hemoglobin prior to delivery to minimize the need for blood transfusion
at delivery.
b. Consider prophylactic TXA (1g) and 400 mcg misoprostol buccally with delivery (to decrease risk of PPH).
18. PPE Considerations during COVID-19 Pandemic for Pregnancy:
a. Screen positive patients (symptoms or prior COVID-19 diagnosis) or PUI:
i. PPE during admission: Surgical mask for all patients with symptoms or COVID-19+/PUI. Airborne precautions: N95 masks and droplet PPE (Gown, gloves, mask/face shield) for all HCP.
b. Screen negative patients (no symptoms or prior COVID-19 diagnosis):
i. PPE during delivery: Surgical mask and droplet PPE (Gown, gloves, mask/face shield) should be
used during all patients in the second stage. N95 Mask could be considered for the surgical team for any cesarean section as there is the potential risk of requiring intubation during the surgery. Provider discretion and individual MTF PPE availability can be considered.(166)

    c. Women who are COVID-19+ or PUI should wear a surgical mask at all times as clinically able.
d. Women who are COVID-19+ or PUI should be placed in an isolation/private room. Airborne infection
isolation rooms (negative pressure rooms), if available, can be used if performance of aerosolizing
procedures is anticipated. In general, isolation rooms with droplet precautions are recommended.
e. Staff PPE:
i. Proper donning and doffing of PPE takes time. Training in the use of PPE should emphasize safety of healthcare workers, recognizing that clinical response times may be slowed by these precautions.
ii. Proper donning and doffing procedures should be reviewed and practiced frequently; Recommend simulated patient transfers (e.g. from L&D to OR).
iii. Recommend posting diagrams and checklists in areas where donning and doffing will occur.
iv. For HCP that do not fit N95 masks, PAPR should be used. For staff in the operating the OR, the PAPR with shroud must be used, followed by sterile gown over the shroud. This ensures proper venting of
the PAPR out the bottom of the surgical mask to ensure sterility of the field.
v. Have an observer witness donning/doffing when possible.
f. Anticipate emergencies as best as possible; plan ahead and proactively intervene for situations that could result in emergent cesarean delivery (e.g. Category II FHR), early peds notification.
g. Collaborate closely with Surgical Services to support additional operating room/staffing capabilities.
h. Define patient OR plan on admission (COVID-19 or not)
i. Coordination with Pediatrics and Neonatology upon admission for any mother COVID-19+ or PUI
18. Considerations for Support Person/VISITORS to L&D and ANTEPARTUM/POSTPARTUM
a. One designated (healthy) support person during the entire admission, easily identifiable by L&D staff. Consider a colored wrist band for identification. Support person should be screened as above, wear a
mask, and remain restricted to the patient room for mothers that are COVID-19 positive or PUI.
b. No children < 16 years permitted.
Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 39

Clinical Management of COVID-19
c. Additional visitors for end-of life situations or bereavement (e.g. IUFD) may be considered/evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
d. All efforts should be made to limit the movement of COVID-19 positive/PUI women from one care area to another. Consider postpartum care in the same room as delivery if possible.
e. If increased prevalence of disease and community transmission is present, individual MTFs could consider a no visitation policy to minimize potential exposure of staff and patients.
19. Anesthesia Considerations for Intrapartum Care (Refer to Implications for Surgical Care Section)
a. Recommend early epidural to minimize need for general anesthesia in the event of an emergent cesarean.
b. COVID-19 is not a contraindication to neuraxial anesthesia.
c. Anticipate emergencies as best as possible; plan ahead and proactively intervene for situations that could
result in emergent cesarean delivery (e.g. Category II FHR tracing).
d. Recommend limiting exposure of trainees to COVID+/PUI, with experienced staff providing care.
e. Suspend nitrous oxide programs on L&D due to possible aerosolization.
20. Care of Critically Ill COVID-19 Pregnant Patient
a. Judicious use of corticosteroids for fetal maturation, balancing gestational age with potential risks of
worsening maternal morbidity. Discussions with critical care team and neonatology.
b. Fetal monitoring: at > 24 weeks, electronic fetal monitoring for antenatal surveillance at least daily.
Recommend additional fetal monitoring with any change in the maternal status if a cesarean at bedside is
feasible. The fetus can be a sixth vital sign reflecting early deterioration in maternal status.
c. Recommend maintaining maternal O2 saturations at > 95%.
d. Pregnancy has a natural respiratory alkalosis with a normal PCO2 of 28-32.
e. Therapy for ARDS involves low tidal volumes and permissive hypercapnia (PCO2 > 60). Data on permissive
hypercapnia in pregnancy are limited, but there do not appear to be adverse fetal effects.
f. It may be necessary to increase tidal volume and/or PEEP to meet goal PaCO2 and oxygenation targets
while remaining mindful not to allow alveolar plateau pressures to exceed 35 cm H2O.
g. Prone ventilation has been found to improve oxygenation in the setting of ARDS and its feasibility and
safety in pregnancy have been documented.
h. In the third trimester, increased PEEP may be required for pregnant moms on mechanical ventilation.
i. Veno-venous ECMO is a proven life-saving salvage therapy for severe reversible respiratory failure, and its
benefit among critically ill pregnant women has been reported.
j. Goal BP should be < 160/110.
k. Patient should be positioned with left lateral tilt (if no other position is mandated for their treatment, for
example, prone position) to relieve pressure from the gravid uterus on venous return.
21. Delivery Planning in ICU
a. Equipment for emergency cesarean delivery should be at bedside, with neonatal resuscitative equipment including warmer.
b. Hemorrhage Code Purple cart stocked with medications and devices should be in the ICU. Medications should readily available include methergine, hemabate, Tranexamic acid (TXA) and misoprostol.
c. Use of terbutaline should be reviewed with critical care team, depending on patient’s clinical status due to the risk of tachycardia.
d. Establish effective means of communication with Nursing, ICU, anesthesia, neonatal, and obstetrical teams.
e. If emergent delivery is planned, this may be performed at bedside in the ICU, or in MOR.
f. Timing – consideration should be given to delivery > 34 weeks for critically ill maternal patient. Delivery
may help optimize maternal status.
g. Intrapartum care if a pregnant patient at term in critical condition goes into labor, precautions as above
should be initiated. Assisted second stage (OB forceps/Vacuum) is likely to be necessary.
h. A dedicated obstetrician should be present at the time of delivery, and infant placed in isolation after
delivery given the unknown risks of transmission.
i. Prevention of postpartum hemorrhage as detailed above.
j. Breast pumping encouraged after review of maternal medications.
22. Postpartum Care
Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 40
 
Clinical Management of COVID-19
a. Women should be notified that in order to limit the risk of infection to themselves, staff and other patients, mothers and infants should be discharged in an expedited and safe fashion. Vaginal deliveries – goal of discharge on postpartum day 1 (same day for select women). Cesarean deliveries – goal of discharge on postpartum day 2. Home blood pressure monitoring devices may be needed.
b. All postpartum visits, including wound checks, should be via telehealth. Can optimize by uploading photos through EMR/patient portals.
23. Obstetric medications
a. Indomethacin – in the setting of indications for tocolysis, nifedipine may be considered as an alternative,
given the uncertainty regarding NSAID impact on COVID-19.
b. Betamethasone/Dexamethasone for fetal maturation – given the association between steroids and
worsening morbidity of viral pneumonia, specifically COVID-19, steroids for fetal maturation should be
used judiciously. AVOID late preterm steroids 34-46 weeks in COVID-19+/PUI patients.
c. Magnesium sulfate is recommended for fetal neuroprotection for anticipated preterm delivery <32 weeks
or for seizure prophylaxis for Preeclampsia with severe features. Given potential respiratory complications, use judiciously in the setting of severe respiratory symptoms. Magnesium sulfate may be used in patients with mild-moderate symptoms, may consider single 4 gm bolus.

                  22. Pregnant patient work restrictions: Delivery is a unique scenario in the COVID-19 pandemic. Hospital admissions for delivery are anticipated around the patient’s due-date. In anticipation of hospital admission for delivery, if feasible and mission permitting, consider having pregnant women work from home at 37 weeks (2 weeks prior to 39 weeks or 2 weeks prior to anticipated delivery), and practice strict social isolation during this time. (166) Strict social isolation is encouraged for the entire family unit. The goal is to limit risk of exposure around the time of delivery. Depending on mission requirements and increasing disease burdens, such accommodations may not be possible but should be considered.(166)
23. Pregnant health care workers: Facilities consider limiting exposure of pregnant HCP to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection, especially during higher-risk procedures such as aerosol generating procedures (intubation, extubation, BiPAP, high flow nasal cannula, nebulized medications and second stage of labor) if feasible based on staffing availability. With ongoing stresses in the MHS and increasing disease burdens, such accommodations may not be possible.
Caring for Infants and Mothers with COVID-19: IPC and Breastfeeding
1. Current evidence is inconclusive about in utero transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mothers with COVID-19 to their newborns. Vertical transmission does not appear to occur, but perinatal infection leading to severe manifestations has been documented. It is unknown whether newborns with COVID-19 are at increased risk for severe complications, but transmission after birth via contact with infectious respiratory secretions is a concern.(170)
2. To reduce the risk of post-natal transmission from mother to infant, the CDC and American Academy of Pediatrics recommends consideration of temporarily separating a symptomatic PUI or COVID-19 positive mothers from her infant (e.g. separate rooms). In the absence of more definitive data, this decision should reflect an individualized risk - benefit consideration for the mother and infant, cognizant of the potential for
Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 41

Clinical Management of COVID-19
delayed maternal-child bonding and impaired breastfeeding. This will require an additional healthy (non-
infected) adult to care for the infant while separated from mother.
3. COVID-19 positive postpartum mothers as well as postpartum PUIs will be counseled about the risks and
benefits of colocation vs. separation.
a. If a postpartum PUI mother elects to be separated from infant and then her test is negative for COVID-19,
the mother and infant can be reunited and ‘room in.’
b. Postpartum COVID-19+ or PUI mothers who elect to co-locate (also referred to as ‘rooming in’) with their
infants should be instructed to wear a facemask at all times. They will also practice hand hygiene before each feeding and wear gloves during infant contact. They will also be encouraged to wash any skin that may come in contact with the infant (e.g. breasts, chest, arms, etc.). They will be encouraged to limit other close contact with the infant(s) and a separate non-infected caregiver should be present to help care for the infant. This separate non-infected caregiver should perform a majority of the infant’s care. While not breastfeeding, infants should be kept greater than 6 feet away from the mother within the room, per CDC guidance.
Lactation: Breastfeeding, Pumping, or Expressed Breast Milk (171)
1. Mothers who wish to breastfeed should be provided with a dedicated breast pump.
(https://consultqd.clevelandclinic.org/managing-pregnancy-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/)
2. Postpartum patients who are pumping should follow CDC guidelines on equipment use and feeding.
3. Collecting Milk:
a. Wipe the surface where syringes/bottles will be placed after collection with a germicidal disposable wipe, and cover surface with clean paper towel or cloth.
b. Mother will wash hands and breasts before use and cleaning equipment before and after use. Mother will wear a mask while pumping.
c. Mother collects breast milk by hand or by pump into clean syringes or bottles then ensures syringe/bottle cap is secured. The outside of the container will be wiped with a germicidal disposable wipe. A label in then placed to identify date, time, and patient.
d. Transport and storage of breast milk from isolation room to common refrigerated storage should follow strict infection control procedures per hospital policy.
Infants
1. Infants born to mothers with confirmed COVID-19 should be considered PUIs.
2. All infants born to mothers with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should, , if resources allow, be resuscitated
in a separate adjacent room utilizing airborne PPE due to potential for aerosolization during the 2nd stage of labor and potential need for intubation of the infant. The infant should be bathed as soon as clinical condition allows.
3. If local resources allow, PUI infants should be tested at ~24 hours with repeat testing at 48 hours.
4. All elective procedures to include circumcision should be deferred while infant is a PUI.
5. If hearing tests can be performed outpatient, it is acceptable to defer until COVID-19 testing is negative. If it is
not easily available outpatient, ensure proper disinfection measures are used when cleaning equipment.
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (172)
1. Recommend any infant who has symptoms that meet criteria for NICU admission be assessed by the NICU
team and admitted to a COVID-19 cohort pod or other segregated section of the unit.
2. Healthcare workers should wear full PPE including N95 (or PAPR), eye shields, gown, hair cover, and gloves
should be worn when caring handling the PUI infant.
a. In situations where there is limited PPE available, N95 (or PAPR) use should be prioritized for use in
infants requiring CPAP, SiPAP or undergoing aerosolizing procedures such as intubation or use of high- flow nasal cannula with flow rate >2LPM/kg.
Newborn Visitation
1. No visitors experiencing cough, fever, or shortness of breath should be allowed in any care setting.
2. All visitors should wear a facemask and adhere to local infection control policies.
Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 42
 
Clinical Management of COVID-19
3. For NICU: COVID-19 positive persons or their household contacts should not be allowed to visit until they meet the following requirements:
a. Resolution of fever without antipyretics for 72 hours
b. Improvement in respiratory symptoms
c. Negative results of a molecular assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2 from at least 2 consecutive nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected at least 24 hours apart.
d. Entrance to other family support personnel should be determined on a case by case basis.
4. For Labor and Delivery, Post-partum / Newborn Nursery: each COVID-19 positive or PUI postpartum mother
may be allowed to have one support person with her who must remain with her throughout the admission. This support person should be isolated to the post-partum room and not traveling elsewhere in the hospital.
a. If the mother chooses to co-locate with the infant, the support person should help with infant care.
b. If the mother chooses to be separated from her infant, the support person may help with the infant’s care
when they are brought to the room.
5. AAP recommends that well newborns, defined as negative molecular testing and asymptomatic, can receive
circumcision. Newborns who are PUIs are not eligible for elective circumcision.
Newborn Discharge
1. After hospital discharge, a mother with COVID-19 is advised to maintain a distance of at least 6 feet from the newborn, and when in closer proximity, to use a mask and hand-hygiene for newborn care until:
a. She is afebrile for 72 hours without use of antipyretics; and
b. At least 7 days have passed since symptoms first appeared.
2. A mother with COVID-19 whose newborn requires ongoing hospital care should maintain separation until: a. She is afebrile for 72 hours without use of antipyretics; and
b. Her respiratory symptoms are improved; and
c. Negative results are obtained from at least two consecutive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab test
collected ≥ 24 hours apart.

Caring for Children with COVID-19
1. Children (0-18 years) make up less than 2% of the laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide, though this may represent an ascertainment bias of symptomatic cases or known contacts.
2. Approximately 90% of children with COVID-19 are more likely to remain asymptomatic or have mildly symptomatic disease. Pediatric symptoms, if present, are similar to common viral respiratory infections with a majority of symptoms affecting the upper airway (rhinorrhea, congestion, cough). This differs from adults, who tend to have lower respiratory symptoms most prominent. Fever is the most common symptom but often brief, lasting only 1-2 days. GI symptoms such as diarrhea have been reported but are less frequent than in adults. Severe symptoms include hypoxia and respiratory distress.(22, 25, 173)
3. Recent reports have identified children presenting with symptoms of a multisystem inflammatory syndrome with features overlapping Kawasaki disease, toxic shock syndromes and myocarditis. Patients present with fevers, progressive hypotension and oxygen requirement along with other variable minor symptoms. Hypotension can be severe with notable decreased EF, dilated coronary arteries, conduction disturbances and/or pericardial effusions. Patients may rapidly progress to requiring VA ECMO support for refractory shock. In addition to supportive hemodynamic interventions and consideration of anti-viral therapy, treatment with IVIG and high dose aspirin is appropriate if patient meets Kawasaki criteria (pre-IVIG plasma and oropharyngeal swabs should be obtained for future studies). Anecdotal reports suggests patients may be COVID-19 PCR negative but antibody positive, often with recent history of minor URI symptoms. Despite severe course outcomes are thus far promising.(174)
4. Hospitalization rates in the US are higher for children 0-4 years-old as compared to 5-17 years-old but both are still markedly below adults. This is consistent with data from China which showed children <5 years-old having
    Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 43

Clinical Management of COVID-19
more severe disease with the highest rates in those <1 year-old. There are case reports in the US of febrile infants <3 months-old who required hospitalization for fever evaluation, all of which was negative except positive for SARS-CoV-2.(25, 175-177)
5. One report found 23% of children with COVID-19 had ≥1 underlying condition with the most common including chronic lung disease (including asthma), cardiovascular disease, and immunosuppression.(173)
6. The mortality rate appears to be extremely low worldwide; total pediatric deaths related to COVID in the single digits per each country. The intersection with chronic pediatric respiratory conditions such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, and chronic lung disease, and with the attendant increased risk of severe disease, is unknown.(178, 179)
7. Respiratory virus co-infections and secondary bacterial infections are possible, but less common. However, the detection of a non-COVID-19 virus does not exclude COVID-19 infection. There are anecdotal, but as yet unpublished reports from Seattle Children’s Hospital of co-infection with Rhinovirus/Enterovirus but the clinical impact is unknown.
8. During periods of community transmission and in the absence of targeted therapy for mild and moderate disease, the decision to test children for SARS-CoV-2 is driven by resource availability, infection prevention and control principles, and epidemiologic contact tracing or hot-spot case finding.
9. Most labs are normal to include inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP), chemistries, kidney and hepatic function. White blood cell count is typically normal but may be low. Procalcitonin may be elevated but might suggest co-infection.(59)
10. When imaging is abnormal in children with COVID-19, CXR reveals non-specific increased lung markings or patchy infiltrates, and chest CT reveals glass opacities and halo signs.(59)
11. Pediatric patients can be considered mild or moderate disease if there is no new supplemental oxygen requirement or no increased requirement for patients who require supplemental oxygen at baseline. A majority of these patients will self-resolve without intervention.
12. Those who require hospitalization should receive supportive care to include critical care interventions as required.

Respiratory Support
i. Use of nasal prongs or nasal cannula may be better tolerated, but the goal is to target SpO2 >94%
during resuscitation, and >90% once stable.
ii. For flows over 3LPM use of a heated/humidified circuit (HHFNC) or non-invasive positive pressure
ventilation (CPAP or BiPAP) are well tolerated but increase aerosolization.
iii. There is no current evidence to alter treatment of severe respiratory failure from standard pediatric
ARDSNet guidelines, including indications for intubation.
iv. When treating ARDS in younger children, the maximal PEEP setting is 15 cm H2O as higher PEEP can
result in decreased cardiac output.
Septic Shock
i. Recognize septic shock in children with any hypotension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] < 5th percentile or > 2 SD below normal for age) or two or more of the following: altered mental state; bradycardia or tachycardia (HR < 90 bpm or > 160 bpm in infants and HR < 70 bpm or > 150 bpm in children); prolonged capillary refill (> 2 sec) or feeble pulses; tachypnea; mottled or cold skin or petechial or purpuric rash; increased lactate; oliguria; hyperthermia or hypothermia
ii. For septic shock in children, give 10–20 mL/kg crystalloid fluid as a bolus as quickly as possible using a manual push and reassess for signs of fluid after each bolus.(120)
iii. Aggressive fluid resuscitation may worsen oxygenation and outcomes so in the absence of shock, fluid boluses should be minimized.
iv. If there is no response to fluid loading or signs of volume overload appear (e.g. jugular venous distension, crackles on lung auscultation, pulmonary edema on imaging, or hepatomegaly), then reduce or discontinue fluid administration.
v. Resuscitation endpoints include perfusion targets (e.g. urine output > 1 mL/kg/hr in children; improved level of consciousness; and resolving lactate).
vi. In children, epinephrine is considered first-line treatment, while norepinephrine can be added if

shock persists despite optimal dose of epinephrine. Antivirals Use – for severe patients only
i. Enrollment in clinical trials or compassionate use of experimental therapies to include antivirals, should be considered for children with severe disease on a case-by-case basis with appropriate monitoring and in consultation with Peds ID when possible.(180)
ii. Remdesivir is available from the manufacturer for children <18 years-old as compassionate use and for children > 12-years old as part of randomized clinical trial (see adjunctive therapies section above for more information).
• Dosing recommendations from Pediatric Infectious Disease Society (verify with manufacturer)
-
-
<40kg: 5mg/kg IV loading dose on day 1; followed by 2.5mg/kg IV Q24hr >40kg: 200mg IV loading dose on day 1; followed by 100mg IV Q24hr
Recommended duration: up to 10 days with 5-day duration favored for fast responders
iii. Hydroxychloroquine may be considered in patients who are not candidates for remdesivir or when remdesivir is not available. However, it is NOT advised to use in combination with azithromycin for
children due to the risk of toxicity, specifically prolongation of QTc. There is emerging data and concerns after safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID.
• Dosing options as recommended from Pediatric Infectious Disease Society
- 13mg/kg/dose (max 800mg) PO followed by 6.5mg/kg/dose (max 400mg) PO at 6, 24, and 48hrs after initial dose
- 6.5mg/kg/dose (max 400mg) PO BID on day 1, followed by 3.25mg/kg/dose (max 200mg) PO BID for up to 3-5 days
-
13. There is no evidence to suggest that prophylaxis is necessary or effective for the majority of children.
14. Children appear to efficiently shed the virus, even if asymptomatic. RNA viral load is detectable in respiratory
secretions for up to 2 weeks and in stool for up to 4 weeks.(181, 182)
15. Given the prolonged duration of shedding of respiratory viruses in children, during periods of community
transmission of SARS-CoV-2, it may be prudent to assume symptomatic children are infected, unless proven otherwise from an infection control standpoint - an issue particularly relevant to caregivers from vulnerable risk populations.
Caring for Older Persons with COVID-19
1. COVID-19 can result in severe disease and death among older adults. Data from China and Italy suggest that the majority of deaths have occurred among adults aged ≥60 years, especially those with underlying health conditions. In the United States, 8 out of 10 deaths have been in adults above age 65. Mortality rates in patients > 85 have ranged 10-27%, and 4-11% among patients 65-84 years.(183, 184)
2. Older adults, especially those that are frail and have multiple comorbidities, may not present with the typical syndrome of fever, fatigue, or cough. Atypical presentation of disease includes tachypnea, delirium, malaise, myalgias, and diarrhea early in the disease course; fever was not as prominent in several cases.(185)
3. Older adults are the highest risk patient group.
4. Have a high index of suspicion for COVID-19 in those patients not at their baseline, especially those residing in
long term care facilities who present with respiratory difficulties, changes in vital signs other than temperature
or other signs of infection or sepsis.
5. Ensure that care for the older adult and severely ill is in keeping with their goals of care, advance directives
and patient and family wishes.
6. Conversations regarding goals of care should continue to be part of routine care.
7. Patients should be informed about their condition & their prognosis (if desired), in a way easy to understand.
8. If the patient is unable to communicate meaningfully, ensure that a surrogate decision maker or health care
agent has been identified in accordance with state law based on facility location.
9. All providers should provide basic symptom management, perform routine discussions about goals of care and
code status in seriously ill patients. If complex symptom management or difficult discussions surrounding
goals of care or code status arise, consult a palliative medicine subspecialist if available at your institution.
10. Symptom management: Aggressive control of symptoms such as pain, dyspnea, or other symptoms relieves
Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 45

Clinical Management of COVID-19
unnecessary suffering, which is crucial for all patients regarding of age, function, comorbidities and prognosis. a. Pain
• Acetaminophen should be used first, typically 500mg every 6 hours as needed.
• If acetaminophen is insufficient, and other modalities such as topical agents are ineffective, start an
opioid for moderate to severe pain (drug, dose, route, and frequency should be individualized and based on symptom severity, kidney/liver function and prior opioid exposure: See Table 7). Consider local supply in drug selection to mitigate risk of drug shortage.
• Start a stimulant laxative, such as Senna 8.6mg PO daily, if prescribing an opioid to prevent constipation. Titrate to effect. Escalate bowel regimen as needed, with a goal of one soft bowel movement at minimum every other day.
b. Dyspnea
• If providing supportive care and supplemental oxygen is ineffective for management of severe
dyspnea, a low-dose opioid may be used to help alleviate symptoms.
11. Communication challenges may be exacerbated by the use of PPE. In patients with sensory impairments it is
important to remember to eliminate or minimize background noise, state information slowly, and avoid
yelling. It may be helpful to display information in writing. Hearing aids/glasses should be worn if available.
12. Older adults, especially those with cognitive impairment, when ill, hospitalized, or placed in a new
environment may become anxious, agitated or less interactive. Delirium, a diagnosis not exclusive to older adults, manifests as acute onset inattention, disorganized thinking and an altered level of consciousness. Delirium may be seen any patient, especially those with severe infection, and those requiring mechanical ventilation. Hyperactive delirium (delirium with agitation) may make management and risk mitigation challenging in those diagnosed with COVID-19. (186)
a. Early recognition and management of delirium is important. Regular delirium screening should occur using validated methods such as the Confusion Assessment Method, bCAM, or the 4AT (www.the4AT.com).(187, 188)
b. Risk factors for delirium include older age, sensory impairment (vision and hearing), history of dementia, patients admitted from long-term care units, and those with serious infection.(189)
c. Management of Delirium: (190, 191)
 Prevention of delirium is the best strategy. Strategies include maintaining normal circadian rhythms,
exposure to natural light, regular reorientation, mobilization, treating pain, fever, and nausea, maintaining oxygenation, avoiding constipation and urinary retention, and performing medication reconciliation to minimize potentially inappropriate medications. Ensure basic needs are met for food and water.
 Standard non-pharmacological approaches such as frequent reorientation, family at bedside, hospital environmental manipulation (maintenance of day/night cycle, appropriate use of TV and lights), calming music, calls from family, and professional sitters should be employed but may not be feasible in an isolation setting.
 In patients with hyperactive delirium, try nonpharmacological techniques first.
 Current evidence does not support routine use of antipsychotics in management of delirium.(192)
 If severe agitation occurs, and nonpharmacological approaches have not been effective or more
rapid control is needed for the safety of the patient or others, antipsychotics may be used but are off- label. When using an antipsychotic, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest amount of time. Of note, all antipsychotics carry a FDA Black Box warning due to an increase in mortality when used in patients with dementia. The patient should be monitored closely for side effects such as QTc prolongation and over sedation.
• Some examples of antipsychotics are Quetiapine 25mg - 50mg PO, Olanzapine 2.5mg - 5mg PO/IM, and Haldol 0.25mg -1mg IV
d. Cautious use of antipsychotic medication is needed especially in patients with movement disorders such as Parkinson’s disease and Lewy Body Dementia as this class of medication may exacerbate extrapyramidal symptoms. Quetiapine is preferred if antipsychotic medications are needed in patients
 Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 46

 Clinical Management of COVID-19
with movement disorders given its lower risk of extrapyramidal symptoms.(193) Any patient is at risk for
acute dystonic reaction to antipsychotic medications.
13. Many older adults will recover from their illness, and it is important to not forget other complications such as
hospital-associated deconditioning, falls and wounds. Standard of care should be provided for these other common complications alongside supportive care for COVID-19. Prompt mobilization and therapy should be started, when able, in accordance with infection control practices. Focusing on other treatable conditions should continue alongside supportive care for COVID-19.
PALLIATIVE MEDICINE DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
Palliative medicine can assist at all stages of contingency/crisis planning. Prepare for increased use of symptom management resources including opioids (morphine IV and PO, hydromorphone IV and PO, oxycodone PO, fentanyl IV and transdermal), and benzodiazepines. Consider dedicated space for end-of-life care beds. Where possible, symptom management resources should be de-conflicted with highly utilized intensive care medications use to prevent and adapt to shortages.
Goals of Care Discussions
(Adapted from vitaltalk.org COVID-19 Open Source Resources. www.vitaltalk.org)
1. Eliciting a patient’s goals of care is integral to providing the best and most appropriate medical care and can
improve resource allocation during a time of scarcity. Engage patients proactively in goals of care discussions
informed by personal values and clinical context.
2. Treat patients and their families with respect and compassion. Quickly and effectively elicit a patient’s
concerns, values, and preferences with a few key statements. Table 7 offers suggestions and examples to help guide your conversations.
Table 7. Difficult Conversations and Scripts for Communicating with Patients and Families
      What the patient/family says What you may say
   Admitting a Patient
  How bad is this?
Is my grandfather going to make it?
Are you saying that no one can visit me?
How can you not let me in for a visit?
 From the information I have now and from my exam, your situation is serious enough that you should be in the hospital. We will know more in the coming hours to days, and we will update you. Who else should know about your/their situation and how will they know?
 I imagine you are scared. Here’s what I can say: because he is 90, and is already dealing with other illnesses, I worry that he is at risk of dying if this worsens in the hospital. While it is too soon to say for certain, what worries you most about that?
 I know it is hard to not have visitors. The risk of spreading the virus to other vulnerable people is so high that they and those they contact will be in more danger if they come into the hospital. I wish things were different.
 The risk of spreading the virus is so high that I am sorry to say we cannot allow visitors. We can help you be in contact electronically. I wish I could let you visit, because I know it’s important, but it is not possible now.

  I want everything possible. I want to live.
I don’t think my grandfather would have wanted this.
I don’t want to end up being a vegetable or on a machine.
I am not sure what my grandfather wanted – we never spoke about it.
 We are doing everything we can. This is a tough and scary situation for many of us. Could we step back for a moment so I can learn more about you? What do I need to know about you to do a better job taking care of you?
 Well, let’s pause and talk about your concern. Can you tell me what we should know to take the best care of him?
 Thank you, it is very important for me to know that. Can you say more about what you mean?
 You know, many people find themselves in the same boat. This is a hard situation. To be honest, given his overall condition now, I worry that further treatments may not be successful in preventing him from dying. In a situation like that, I have recommended that we allow a natural death. That could be hard to hear. What do you think?
         When coping needs to be boosted, or emotions are running high
  I’m scared.
I need some hope.
You people are incompetent!
I want to talk to your boss.
Do I need to say my goodbyes?
 This is such a tough situation. I think anyone would be scared. Could you share more with me?
 Tell me about the things you are hoping for? I want to understand more.
 I can see you are not happy with things. I am willing to do what is in my power to improve
things for you. What could I do that would help?
 I can see you are frustrated. I will ask my boss to come by as soon as they can. Please
realize that they are juggling many things right now.
 I'm hoping that's not the case and I worry time could indeed be short. What is most
pressing on your mind?

Symptom Management Guidelines
(Adapted from BC Centre for Palliative Care COVID-19 Resources and Information, bc-cpc.ca/cpc)
1. Patients with COVID-19 infections experience many of the same symptoms as other patients: dyspnea, oral secretions, anxiety and pain. Symptom management should be individualized based on clinical status.
a. Dyspnea – dyspnea can present as anxiety – treat the dyspnea!
 Non-pharmacologic management for shortness of breath:
• Positioning, cool room temperatures, removing restrictive clothing
• Avoid bedside fan for patients with COVID-19. Consider bronchodilator therapy, fluid overload
therapies, and heart rate control if >120 BPM. h:
• Opioids are the mainstay of comfort care in severe dyspnea. When dosed effectively to control
dyspnea, they do not contribute to a hastened death.
• Treat and reassess. IV opioids works within 10-15 min, oral opioids within 30-45 min.
 Goals for treatment: respiratory rate <25, minimal use of accessory muscles, resolution of pursed lip breathing, nasal flaring, and retractions or subjective dyspnea. Patient comfort is the goal.
 See Table 8 for recommended opioid dosing. If the dose does not work, increase it!
b. Respiratory Secretions/Congestion Near End of Life
 Discuss congestion and secretions with family and bedside staff. Pharyngeal secretions are normal at end of life and rarely require treatment. A productive cough may benefit from mucolytics or opioids (Table 7). Limit oropharyngeal suction. Reduce or stop saline infusions.
 Medications may include:
 Glycopyrolate 0.4 mg SQ/IV q4H PRN
 If severe and refractory to above medications, consider:
 Furosemide 20 mg SQ/IV q2h PRN with close monitoring of response.

    Intermittent Dosing
   Dosing for Opioid Naïve Patient (patient not on opioid therapy) (For frail, elderly patients, begin at low end of any range)
  Morphine Hydromorphone
 15 mg tablet 1⁄2 to 1 tab PO q 3 hours prn OR 5 mg SQ/IV q1H PRN shortness of breath (SQ/IV can be given as frequently as q30min PRN)
 2 mg tablet 1⁄2 to 1 tab PO q 3 hours prn OR 0.4-0.8 mg SQ/IV q1H PRN shortness of breath (SQ/IV can be given as frequently as q30min PRN)
 If more than 6 PRN doses of opioid in 24 hours:
Consider a basal opioid such as MSContin 15 mg PO BID. If patient unable to make needs known, consider SCHEDULED dosing of the immediate release opioid (q4H or 6H for frail elderly) AND continue PRN dose.
TITRATE UP AS NEEDED for relief of dyspnea and/or pain

PCA Infusion Pump Strategy for Patient ALREADY Taking Opioids
    
For patients on chronic opioid therapy, rotate their long acting medication into the basal rate of your PCA. Titrate to effect. Bolus doses may be given q10 to 15min PRN; if the patient is NOT able to use the button, add a nurse administered bolus order of 5 mg IV q 2 hour prn for morphine PCAs and 0.8 mg IV q 2 hour prn for hydromorphone PCAs.
 Example titration: You start a morphine PCA at 1 mg/hr basal rate with 1 mg q 15 minutes rescue. The patient presses the button every 15 minutes and says he “feels nothing” and continues to be short of breath. Increase the rescue dose to 2 mg and reassess.
 Adjust bolus doses to 50-100% of new continuous infusion rate (e.g. Bolus dose of 2-4 mg q15min PRN for new rate of 4mg/h).  New rate can be reassessed for adjustment again in 3-4 hours.
 Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 48

Clinical Management of COVID-19
c. Anxiety
• Patients with dyspnea have associated fear and anxiety-- opioids are the first line of treatment. The
following adjuncts may be helpful in refractory anxiety:
• Lorazepam 0.5 – 1 mg PO/IV q1-4H PRN, consider scheduling Q4H if goals are for comfort-
directed care and the patient is requiring frequent PRN dosing.
• Midazolam 1 – 4 mg SQ/IV q30min PRN, consider scheduling Q4H if goals are for comfort-
directed care and the patient is requiring frequent PRN dosing. (for severe anxiety or SOB in ICU)
d. Delirium
• Delirium, either hypoactive or agitation, is common in hospitalized patients and can be distressing.
Avoid benzos. Treat underlying causes of delirium if possible.
• Haloperidol 0.5 mg PO OR 0.5 – 1 mg IV q4H PRN. Consider scheduling the medication Q4H
if requiring frequent PRN dosing. Titrate dose in 0.5mg increments.
• Olanzapine 2.5 – 5 mg PO qHS and q8 hr PRN. This comes as a regular or oral dissolving
tablet and can be titrated.
e. Constipation
• Use of opioids will cause constipation. If the patient has more than 24 hours to live:
 Start a stimulant laxative, such as Senna 8.6mg PO daily if they are tolerating PO.
 PRN enema if unable to take PO and patient uncomfortable from distention
• Escalate bowel regimen as needed, with a goal of one soft bowel movement at minimum
every other day.
Palliative Ventilator De-Escalation
(Adapted from “Palliative Ventilator De-escalation Recommendations for COVID-19 Positive or PUI. Developed by Bartlett, Christi for The University of Kansas Health System)
The following protocol is assumed to take place after appropriate goals of care discussions with family and/or surrogate decision makers. The endotracheal tube will remain in place and the ventilator circuit will remain intact to reduce the risk of COVID-19 exposure.
Pre-Procedure.
1. Prepare family that prognosis can be as short as a few minutes but as long as a few days.
2. Deactivate defibrillators first. A magnet can also be placed over the device if needed to deactivate.
3. Ensure no paralytic medications are on board.
4. Code status should be DNR/ comfort measures only for patients at the end of life.
5. Discontinue tube feeds and remove unnecessary equipment from the room.
Procedure.
1. Turn off alarms and change room monitor to comfort care setting or turn off if family is present.
2. If a continuous opioid infusion is in place, continue THE SAME medication. All opioids contribute to relief of
pain/dyspnea.
3. If the patient is already on a continuous opioid infusion, double current drip rate and order bolus doses of 100-
200% of drip rate to be given q10min PRN. Use bedside infusion to provide boluses whenever possible.
4. If the patient is opioid naïve and not on a continuous infusion, begin with morphine 5mg IV or hydromorphone
0.5 – 1 mg IV q10min PRN. If possible, bring at least four doses into patient room for ventilator de-escalation.
5. Order midazolam 2-4 mg q10min PRN or lorazepam 2 mg q30min PRN for anxiety/breathlessness. If patient is
already on a midazolam continuous infusion, double current rate and give boluses of 100-200% of drip rate
available q10min PRN. Use bedside infusion to provide boluses PRN.
6. Pre-medicate with an opioid bolus as above (100% of drip rate) 10 minutes prior to de-escalation.
7. Pre-medicate with 2 – 4 mg of midazolam 10-15 min or 1 – 2 mg of IV lorazepam or prior to de-escalation.
8. Recommend glycopyrrolate 0.4 mg IV q4H PRN for secretions.
9. If patient requires sedative medication (propofol, precedex, etc) for comfort, continue as ventilator is weaned.
10. Stop vasopressors prior to weaning ventilator.
11. Ensure that patient appears comfortable prior to reducing ventilator settings. Titrate to comfort to palliate
signs of discomfort: grimacing, agitations, or labored respirations.
12. For agitation/delirium management, consider Haloperidol 0.5 – 1 mg IV q30mins PRN.
13. If patient is obtunded and expected to die abruptly after ventilator is weaned, recommend immediate
Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 49

Clinical Management of COVID-19
reduction in ventilator settings to pressure support 5/5 and room air. Bolus opioid and benzodiazepine
aggressively as needed to ensure comfort.
14. If the patient is alert, consider a gradual reduction in ventilator settings. Decrease FiO2 to 40%, PEEP to 10, RR
to 16. Recheck patient comfort and re-bolus opioids prn to achieve comfort. Reduce PEEP to 5, FiO2 to 0.21.
15. Once the ventilator is set at PS 5/5 and FiO2 of 21%, leave endotracheal tube in place and leave the ventilator
circuit intact for the end of life.
16. Continue to re-bolus opioids, benzodiazepines and sedation as needed to ensure comfort.
IMPLICATIONS OF COVID-19 ON SURGICAL CARE
Priorities for Surgical Resources
Force Protection: Protection of personnel and patients from disease transmission
Mission Capability: Maintaining capability to provide safe and effective surgical care
Mission Support: Support of the healthcare community response to COVID-19 through preservation of critical resources and re-deployment of personnel
Surgical Triage and Decision-making
The ability to provide surgical care should be determined by health protection conditions, local and regional healthcare capability and capacity with consideration of logistic constraints.
1. During sustained or widespread community transmission, surgical care should be restricted to reduce risks of transmission between patients and healthcare personnel. To the extent possible, clinical encounters should be accomplished through virtual means and surgical treatment options deferred or delayed.(194)
2. MTFs should establish a review process to triage and prioritize medically necessary and time-sensitive surgical care.(195) This process should include multidisciplinary representation and be led by a senior surgeon, preferably the Department/Service Chief.(196)
a. This review should consider medically necessity, time sensitivity, risk and impact of viral transmission
to either the patient or medical personnel, suitability of alternative treatment options, resource
utilization, impact of delay of treatment, as well as readiness and mission impact.
b. Consider using an acuity scale or scoring system to assist in decision making.(197)
3. Preoperative COVID-19 testing is recommended to assist in decision-making for all surgical patients including symptomatic and asymptomatic. In the event of a positive test, the surgical treatment plan can be reconsidered to reduce patient risk of morbidity and mortality and to reduce the risk of transmission to medical personnel and the community.
4. In areas with low incidence or sustained reduction in the rate of new COVID-19 cases, expansion of surgical services should be considered.(198) Surgical services must adapt traditional and contingency operations into a new normal of patient care in the setting of ongoing COVID-19 risk. The surgical review and triage process should continue to prioritize surgical care as outlined in 2a above but can apply a progressively lower threshold to proceed with surgical care and utilization of healthcare resources.
5. Prior to resumption of elective surgery, the following should be established:
a. Local Objective Triggers: Transition of an MTF to the next phase of medical activities should be guided by
the local Health Protection Condition (HPCON) level or guidance from local or state governments or from the Uniformed Military Department or installation commander, in addition to DHA recommendations based on coordination in key healthcare-sustaining areas discussed below. Triggers at the local level are:
i. Symptoms: Downward trajectory of influenza-like illnesses (ILI) reported within a 14-day period; and a downward trajectory of COVID-like cases reported within a 4-day period.
ii. Cases: Downward trajectory of documented cases within a 14-day period or a downward trajectory of positive tests as a percent of total tests within a 14-day period (flat or increasing volume of tests).
iii. Hospitals: Treat all patients without crisis care; and robust testing program in place for at-risk HCP.
  Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 50

Clinical Management of COVID-19
b. Sufficient resources are available across phases of care, including PPE, healthy workforce, facilities, supplies, testing capacity, and post-acute care.
i. Performance of elective surgery must not negatively impact capability to provide medically necessary and time sensitive surgical care.
ii. Surge capacity should be preserved.
c. Policies and process are established for perioperative screening and testing of surgical patients.
d. Evidence-based infection prevention policies and procedures are established to ensure a safe environment
in which elective surgery can occur. (i.e., access control, workflow and distancing)
e. Non-COVID Care areas should be established to reduce risk of COVID-19 exposure and transmission;
preferably these areas should be separate from other facilities to the extent possible (i.e., separate building, or designated rooms or floor with a separate entrance and minimal crossover with COVID-19 areas).
f. CONUS: The guidelines for “Opening Up American Again” based on Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services recommendations offer the following 3 phases:(199)
i. Phase 1: Elective surgeries and procedures can resume, as clinically appropriate, on an outpatient basis
ii. Phase 2: Elective surgeries and procedures can resume, as clinically appropriate, on in-patient bases
iii. Phase 3: Patient care as indicated. Visits to hospitals can resume. Those who do interact with
patients must adhere to strict hygiene protocols.
Phases of Surgical Care Recommendations
Preoperative Care.
1. Virtual and telehealth should be utilized to accomplish preoperative administrative tasks, education, and assessments that do not require face to face interaction.
2. Post-operative care needs should be assessed and resource availability confirmed.
3. Patients planned for surgical care should be screened for symptoms or exposure history. Those patients that
screen positive should undergo testing and their surgical treatment plan should be reconsidered.
4. When available, preoperative COVID testing should be performed to identify asymptomatic patients whose
surgical care plan can be altered in the event of a positive test result. Timing of the test should balance considerations regarding the availability and turnaround time of test against the risk of patient exposure and infection in the interval between testing and the scheduled procedure.
Immediate Preoperative Care.
1. Recommend establishing Intubation Teams consisting of providers with a high degree of comfort with PPE and airway skills. Teams should bring their own PPE, medications, and airway equipment to avoid delays while limited or unfamiliar PPE is made available. During the pandemic, any emergency airway should be treated as potentially COVID-19 positive and full PPE worn.
2. For purposes of perioperative care, patients should be treated as presumed COVID-19 positive if they have symptoms/exposure history that warrants testing. PUI patients at MTFs without an urgent indication for surgery preferably are tested for COVID-19 before any operative intervention (provided testing availability).
a. Surgeries and procedures on COVID-19 positive patients and PUIs when possible should occur in a
negative pressure room or an OR equipped with HEPA-rated filters on all air outflow vents.
b. Optimally, an OR or pod of ORs should be predesignated with a distinct anteroom to maintain separation
from non COVID-19 patients. If a negative pressure OR is not available, consult with facilities to ensure air
handling is routed through a HEPA filter.
3. All patient interaction with COVID-19 positive or PUI patients will be performed with airborne and contact
precautions, including eye protection:
a. N95 mask with surgical mask over the N95 mask, consider PAPR for aerosol generating procedures.
b. Eye protection consisting of goggles, full face shield/mask worn over N95, or plastic disposable wrap-
Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 51

Clinical Management of COVID-19
around glasses. Eyeglasses alone are not adequate.
c. Gown, double gloves, hair cover, shoe covers
d. Remove PPE except N95 mask before exiting the room. Surgical scrubs should be changed after each case.
4. The anesthesia service provider should attempt to remove all necessary medications and equipment from the carts prior to bringing the patient into the room. Avoiding contamination of the carts/machine should be prioritized over wasting consumable supplies.
5. Anesthesia providers should not expect routine breaks during the case. Consider leaving cell phones, smart watches, and other personal devices out of the OR. Ensure there’s a way to communicate/call for assistance organic to the OR.
6. Patients on the ward should be transported directly to the OR by the anesthesia service team. If assistance is needed with transport, every attempt should be made to enroll a member from the care team (nurse, surgeon, technician, etc.) to minimize staff exposure.
Intraoperative Care. (200, 201)
1. Surgeons and non-essential staff should not be present in the OR for either intubation or extubation unless
necessary for patient safety.
2. Only essential staff should be present in the OR during surgery, and should all be wearing enhanced droplet
PPE at minimum.
3. Laryngoscopy and Intubation should be performed in accordance with Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation
(APSF) guidelines.(202)
4. Place a HME/HEPA filter between the Y-piece of the breathing circuit and the patient's mask, endotracheal
tube or laryngeal mask airway. The gas sampling line must exit the circuit proximal (closer to the machine) than the filter. The ASA/APSF recommends adding a second HME/HEPA filter on the expiratory limb before entering the anesthesia machine.
5. For sedation cases, a procedural/OR mask should be placed on the patient over the oxygen source. If a gas sampling line is used to monitor end tidal CO2, ensure a filter is used prior to gases entering the machine. The filter found in most epidural kits may be placed in-line and provide adequate machine protection. For sedation procedures that instrument the esophagus (TEE, EGDs) and generate high volume aerosolized secretions, intubation may be the best way to limit room exposure. Alternately, a Procedural Oxygen Mask may limit room exposure where intubation is contraindicated.
6. For pediatric patients or patients in whom the additional dead space or weight of the filter may be problematic, the HEPA filter can be placed on the expiratory end of the corrugated breathing circuit before expired gas enters the anesthesia machine. Again, ensure the gas sampling line is protected from contaminating the anesthesia machine.
7. Use disposable covers whenever possible (e.g., plastic sheets for surfaces, long ultrasound probe sheath covers) to reduce droplet and contact contamination of equipment and other environmental surfaces.
Postoperative Care.
1. Non-ICU patients should recover in a PACU negative pressure room. If a suitable recovery room isn’t available, the OR may substitute until ready for Phase II.
2. Remove all PPE (except N95 mask) before exiting the OR. Avoid touching hair or face & perform hand hygiene.
3. Surgical scrubs should be changed immediately at the conclusion of each case.
4. Cloth surgical caps should not be worn in PUI cases.
5. Shoes should be disinfected routinely after each case.
6. The room should be cleaned in accordance with the designated processes for terminally cleaning rooms for a highly infectious agent.
7. Once the patient has left the operating room, leave as much time as possible prior to subsequent patient care to allow removal of airborne infectious contamination. Consult with physical facilities for the air exchange of each procedural room and the wait time required to provide maximum efficiency.
8. When transporting a ventilated patient, ensure a HEPA filter is placed between the ETT and the Ambu bag. Connect the Ambu bag to the ETT prior to opening the door in the negative pressure room. Ensure the door is closed when returning the patient before switching to the ventilator. The same filter may also be used on the
Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 52

Clinical Management of COVID-19
exhalation loop of the anesthesia machine.
9. When transporting patients between the OR, a “clean” person who does not contact the patient should
accompany the team to safely interact with the environment (e.g. open doors or elevators).
Post-discharge Care.
1. Post-discharge care needs should be assessed and resource availability confirmed.
2. Discharge care plans should consider the risks of exposure from extended healthcare stay (nursing home or
other inpatient care facility) and face to face follow-up.
3. Virtual and telehealth should be utilized to accomplish postoperative assessments that do not require face to
face interaction.
Special Considerations
Aerosol-Generating Procedures.
Viral concentration in the aerodigestive tract and respiratory system and aerosol generation during surgical care present additional risks to surgical personnel.
1. The performance of high-risk procedures should be limited and risk mitigated through refinement of
technique and/or utilization of adjunctive technology and protections. High risk activities include:
a. Endotracheal intubation
b. Oral surgery
c. Tracheostomy and endotracheal tube manipulation/care
d. Upper aerodigestive endoscopy (including nasal endoscopy, laryngoscopy, bronchoscopy, and esophago- gastro-duodenoscopy)
e. Surgery involving the airway/upper aerodigestive tract, lower airways, or the potential to enter into the upper aerodigestive tract or lower airway.
2. Aerosol generation during surgical procedures can also be limited through the following:
a. Electrocautery should be set to the lowest effective setting and a smoke evacuator used if available.
b. Chest tubes and surgical drains are all potential sources of aerosolized droplets, and enhanced precautions
should be taken during placement, manipulation, or removal.
3. Laparoscopy and Endoscopy: Aerosol generation during laparoscopy can be minimized through scrupulous
management of access sites, pnuemoperitoneum, and through ultrafiltration of aerosolized particles in released CO2.(203)
a. CO2 insufflation should be set to the lowest effective pressure, and a filtration device should be used for
CO2 release if available.
b. Release all pneumoperitoneum via filtration device (if available) prior to specimen removal, port removal,
or converting to open surgery.
c. Avoid venting insufflation from the ports during surgery.
d. Aerosol generation during endoscopy may be difficult to control, therefore performance of these
procedures should be carefully considered and engineering controls and PPE optimized to reduce the risk of personnel exposure.
Trauma and Surgical Combat Casualty Care. (204)
1. Deployed medical/surgical capability is a limited and mission-critical asset that must be preserved to reduce
risk to the force and mission. To that end, all reasonable attempts should be made to preserve medical and
surgical capability on the battlefield.
2. In the deployed setting, when possible, designate a single OR for PUI/COVID-19 positive surgical care and
minimize unnecessary supplies and equipment in that room. This surgical suite should undergo terminal
cleaning after each case.
3. All trauma/injured patients should be presumed positive/PUI in the downrange setting until they can be ruled
out (by testing or risk factor assessment).
a. Trauma team members should all wear airborne and contact precautions, including eye protection for PPE
until the patient is ruled out for COVID-19.
Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 53

Clinical Management of COVID-19
b. Unnecessary individuals in the trauma bay should be minimized.
c. Individuals should remove all PPE (except N95 mask) prior to exiting the resuscitation area.
• Any clothing worn in the resuscitation bay/ATLS area should be removed after PUI patient contact and immediately cleaned
• Commanders should modify uniform requirements as necessary to allow for multiple rapid clothing changes to avoid cross contamination.
d. All equipment in the resuscitation bay and ATLS area (i.e. x-ray, ultrasound, instrument packs, etc.) must be terminally cleaned after every PUI encounter.
e. Non-intubated patients who cannot be ruled out for COVID-19 should have a surgical mask applied during transport between the resuscitation bay and CT scanner and during any transit within the facility. Patients requiring oxygen should have a non-rebreather mask applied instead of a simple face mask.
f. All PUIs requiring admission should be kept in isolation rooms (if available) until ruled out or ready for discharge (to quarantine facilities).
4. Staffing risk reduction
a. Aerosol producing procedures should have only necessary staff members present in the room (i.e.
intubation, chest tube placement, etc.), and all staff must wear enhanced droplet precaution PPE.
b. Each facility should consider options to minimize staff members entering the resuscitation area. This could include the use of runners or pass-through windows for deliveries from pharmacy, lab, etc.
c. All visitors should be restricted during the initial phase of resuscitation, and based on risk, may be restricted throughout the entire hospitalization at the discretion of the Commander.
5. Consultations and therapies should be performed as needed and not delayed solely because a casualty is pending COVID-19 rule-out. This includes specialty and subspecialty consultations, routine nursing care (i.e. pressure injury reduction, oral care, etc.), radiology, lab analyses, and physical/occupational/speech therapy.
OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR COVID-19: PLANNING AND PREPARATION
Providing safe and effective care in the deployed setting during an infectious disease pandemic is particularly challenging given limited resources, close living conditions, and delays in test results and supply arrival. The DOD GCP PI & ID 3551-13 provide a wealth of information, guidelines, and mitigation strategies for a pandemic, but are not tailored to the risks, needs and nuances of COVID-19. This section focuses on the unique aspects of dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic in the deployed environment. Collaboration between base commanders and medical teams is an essential component of pandemic response to limit infection spread while caring for the ill and injured. Additionally, coordination with TRANSCOM is essential as some Geographic Combatant Commanders (GCC) have published orders indicating all COVID positive service members will be transported out of theater while others have maintained treatment in place unless the patient exceeds the capability of the treating facility.
Division of Labor for Quarantine and Isolation.
1. Quarantine: This is a medically-supported command function to separate high risk individuals from the general population following a potential exposure. Commanders are responsible for establishing and maintaining quarantine facilities within their area of responsibility (AOR), and each unit is responsible to identify at-risk personnel based on best medical guidance. Quarantine has also been advocated for those units who are mobilizing to a base where there are no reported cases of COVID in an effort to maintain the bases status. In these case units mobilizing to those bases should do a formal quarantine either prior to arrival or prior to interacting with anyone on the base. If the 14 day quarantine is done prior to arrival the unit cannot interact with anyone as there is risk of transmission from an asymptomatic carrier.
2. Isolation: This is a command-supported medical function to care for those with infection. These patients are identified by symptoms (i.e. fever, cough, dyspnea, diarrhea, etc.) following an exposure (typically within the past 14 days), and may be identified de novo or from quarantine. The duration of isolation is can vary based upon the duration of symptoms or the results of testing (see below). Because service members are not deployed with a family, even mildly symptomatic patients, who would typically be returned to the care of their family in the garrison setting, become the responsibility of the medical team.
    Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 54

Clinical Management of COVID-19
Physical Requirements and Logistics of Quarantine and Isolation.
1. Quarantine: Quarters must be provided for persons suspected of having exposure to COVID-19 in an effort to prevent spread of the disease to other service members (SM) and civilians on base. These quarters must be separate from the general population and must have their own dedicated toilet and shower facilities. Meals must be provided to quarantined individuals, and they must be checked regularly (i.e. via telephone or in person) to ensure they remain asymptomatic. If symptoms develop, medical personnel should be notified to arrange evaluation and potential transfer to medical isolation. Quarantined individuals should remain in their designated quarters unless directed otherwise, however, quarantined individuals should be allowed to go outside and exercise in wide open areas to promote mental and physical health. Personnel should be designated to do laundry for quarantined individuals. Dirty laundry should be placed in a sealed disposable plastic bag by the quarantined member and then handled with gloves by laundry personnel. Laundry should be placed in the washing machine without handling the clothes, and the bag discarded in an appropriate receptacle. Persons in quarantine should remain in quarantine for the allotted 14 days unless it is determined that the person they were suspected of being exposed to is determined not to be infected with COVID-19. The 14 day quarantine resets if any person in the same living quarters develops symptoms, has a positive test result, or if a new person is added to the quarantine group living quarters. To avoid excessively prolonged quarantines, every effort should be made to keep quarantined individuals in the smallest possible groups; individual quarters are the ideal quarantine environment. Any personnel interacting with or evaluating quarantined individuals must wear appropriate PPE.
2. Isolation: Patients who are symptomatic or test positive should become the primary responsibility of the medical team in isolation. Medical teams will need to plan for patient monitoring, treatment, housing, meal, and hygiene facilities. Based on the demand and the size of the medical treatment unit, commanders may need to consider assigning additional non-medical personnel to assist with these tasks. Isolated patients should be classified by symptoms as asymptomatic, mild, moderate, or severe, which will determine the required level of care. Any personnel interacting or evaluating patients in isolation must wear appropriate PPE.
a. Asymptomatic/Mild Symptoms: In CONUS locations these patients may be sent home for self-care and
outpatient follow-up. In the deployed setting family support is absent and self-isolation is not feasible, so medical teams should coordinate with command to establish appropriate isolation housing with routine medical oversight and documentation. Symptom progression should result in medical reevaluation. There must be a clear and universally-accessible communication plan for notifying the duty medical personnel of a change in patient condition.
b. Moderate Symptoms: These patients require hospital ward admission. These facilities may be located within the MTF or established separately near the MTF; if available, negative pressure facilities should be reserved for aerosol producing procedures. A COVID-19 positive patient should not share a room with a non-COVID-19 patient.
c. Severe Symptoms: These patients require ICU admission for hemodynamic monitoring/treatment or severe respiratory symptoms. ICU care should be performed where the greatest medical capability exists, but these patient should not be placed in the same facility as trauma patients or medically sick patients. Negative pressure facilities should be used (if available) during aerosol producing procedures. If negative pressure facilities are not available then a stand-alone well-ventilated tend or building can be used. Oxygen generating capability will need to be established along with continuous patient monitoring and nursing. This level of care can be resource intensive and medical teams will need to work with TRANSCOM on possible patient transfer if they do not have adequate resources.
d. Discharge: Patient placed in isolation should be classified as patients under investigation (PUI) while awaiting their test results. They will need to remain in isolation for 7 days and until their symptoms have resolved for 72 hours off antipyretics if the test positive for COVID. Alternatively, they can be released from isolation if they have two negative COVID tests after their positive test. If their initial COVID test is negative they should remain in isolation for at least 7 days unless an alternative diagnosis can be rendered for their symptoms (ie community acquired pneumonia, lymphoma, rhabdomyolysis).
Unique Limitations in the Austere Environment
  Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 55

Clinical Management of COVID-19
1. Ventilator: COVID-19 may result in ARDS which can be challenging to manage even with the best facilities and equipment; in the deployed setting, providers may only have transport ventilators with limited capabilities. It is important to recognize this limitation and prepare accordingly. Medical teams should train and exercise protocols for prone positioning and pharmacologic paralysis which have proven mortality benefit if used early in ARDS.
2. Medications: At present, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19. Deployed providers may not have access to compassionate use or trial medications, and should be familiar with the supportive care measures described elsewhere in this document. Additionally, the Society of Critical Care Medicine, ARDSNet, and other professional societies provide continuously updated guidelines on their websites. Providers should work closely with pharmacy and logistics leadership to ensure adequate stocks of all commonly required medications, including antimicrobials, sedation, and paralytics.
3. PPE: Supply chain challenges have led to PPE shortages worldwide. Fortunately most units are deployed with CBRNE equipment which can be used for filtration and staff protection. Staff must be proficient at proper donning, doffing, and cleaning techniques.
4. Hygiene: The austere environment lends itself to rapid spread of infectious disease. Commands should emphasize the importance of handwashing/sanitizing, cleaning quarters, and appropriate social distancing.
5. Testing: Epidemiologic data is critical for command decision making, therefore commanders may need to divert resources to ensure rapid case identification and intervention. MTFs should not use non-DOD laboratories for testing unless approved by their AOR HQ.
6. Transportation: Units must coordinate with PMC to ensure safe and efficient movement of patients and/or testing samples around theater. Patients can be treated in place unless their clinical condition necessitates a higher level of care or if command directs movement of COVID-19 positive patients. Unnecessary patient movement should be avoided to minimize personnel and resource exposure and transmission risk. TRANSCOM has developed 3 categories for patients based on their oxygen requirement to facilitate planning for safe medical evacuation of patients.
a. Category A: intubated or O2 sats <85% on RA and <92% on 5 L/m O2
b. Category B: O2 sats <90% on RA or sats >92% on 4 L/m O2
c. Category C: O2 sats >92% on RA
7. Housekeeping and Cleaning Services: Cleaning protocols must be established to ensure adequate sanitization occurs in quarantine, isolation, and medical facilities, as well as workspaces and quarters of those moved to quarantine/isolation status. PPE should be worn by cleaning personnel and disposed of in a manner that avoids the potential for cross-contamination.
8. Mortuary Affairs and Casualty Liaison Teams: While the COVID-19 mortality rate is expected to be low in the typical deployed population, Mortuary Affairs teams should be prepared for increased demands and requirements. Casualty Liaison teams should be ready to work with commanders, medical teams and families on accurately reporting patient status.
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND WELLNESS IN COVID-19 CLINICAL MANAGEMENT For Defense Health Agency COVID-19 Related Behavioral Health (BH) Resources:
https://info.health.mil/army/bhsl/Covid19/Forms/AllItems.aspx (DoD CAC Enabled only)
Pandemic conditions require medical staff to be sensitive and responsive to patient, family, provider, and leader needs. Common pandemic responses include a predictable range of distress reactions (e.g. insomnia, fear, grief), health risk behaviors (e.g. increased use of alcohol/other substances, work/life imbalance), and may also result in BH disorders (e.g. PTSD, depression, and anxiety). In response to multiple stressors, associated with quarantine or in support of critical care operations, common responses may also include anger, irritability, detachment, avoidance, impaired function, and burnout. Addressing stress responses early can mitigate enduring impacts.
General Considerations for Frontline Workers, First Responders, and Support Staff
1. Prioritize basic needs. Proper sleep, nutrition and hydration, regular exercise, regular breaks, and appreciation/gratitude can sustain performance and enhance decision-making.
Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 56
             
Clinical Management of COVID-19
2. Social distancing, infection control, and isolation present a significant barrier to our usual approach to care, requiring innovative approaches.
3. Communication – words matter now more than ever. Clear and consistent messaging from leadership, between team members, and to patients and family is vital during this crisis.
4. Anticipate fears of returning to work and provide thoughtful, transparent information.
5. Resources for leaders in support of Healthcare Workers can be found at: https://www.cstsonline.org/covid-
19/supporting-healthcare-workers
General BH Care for Patients with known or suspected COVID-19
1. In accordance with HPCON, use telehealth and virtualization tools as much as possible for BH assessments and ongoing care of isolated patients. Promptly identify all COVID-19 patients with known mental illness and consult BH to assist with ongoing care.
2. Recognize isolation as a barrier to communication. Keeping patients informed as to what is happening, what is likely to happen, and next steps in their care may provide a sense of control in the midst of a stressful and confusing situation. Expand virtual approaches to care and provide regular updates to patients and families.
3. Anticipate patient concerns and misconceptions. Concerns that may be present include fears related to transmission to family members, fears related to intensive care or ventilator availability, duration and impact of isolation, or external stressors such as impact on job, housing, and finances.
4. Healthcare systems should establish easily accessible pathways for BH referrals for family members of patients admitted for COVID-19.
5. Attend to negative impacts of isolation by facilitating virtual connection with providers, family, and loved ones as much as possible. This could include providing patients with dedicated mobile devices/tablets.
6. Resources to help in caring for Patients and Families can be found at: https://www.cstsonline.org/covid- 19/caring-for-patients-and-families
For Medical Staff
1. Self-care is important for providers, patients, and families.
2. Connect to a sense of unified purpose; foster hope, fortitude, and tolerance in self and others.
3. Amplify positive stories and stories about competent efforts by self and colleagues. Encourage perceptions of
competence among staff, especially junior and/or less experienced colleagues.
4. Recognize and attend to signs of stress reactions or burnout in self and others (e.g. out of character sadness,
frustration, irritability, isolation/disconnectedness, substance use, and lack of self-care). Usually these can be addressed with simple measures, including normalization, peer-support, and rest with expectation of rapid return to full functioning.
5. Focus on what can be controlled – checklists, routines, self-care; and accept what cannot be controlled.
6. Promote a climate where it is acceptable for team members to talk about difficult events (e.g., death, triage,
errors), as avoidance and fear of such thoughts are associated with greater long-term mental health problems.
7. Establish a routine of regular team meetings as an opportunity to pass relevant information, but also as an
opportunity to check in with each other and rotate duties as needed. Maintain a climate where it is okay to
not be okay and offer peer support when needed.
8. Resources for Healthcare Worker Self Care can be found at: https://www.cstsonline.org/covid-19/healthcare-
worker-self-care
For BH Providers
1. Provide proactive support to frontline workers where possible, and at times of peak stress, ideally, in the form of BH outreach teams with established relationships to frontline and medical staff points of contact. Consider BH team outreach routinely (e.g. during daily rounds, at shift changes).
2. Be careful not to overlook other at risk groups such as janitorial staff, transport, food service, and others who make the medical system run, and may also be at risk of exposure and are likely to experience distress.
3. Behavioral health care teams can provide both non-clinical support to frontline staff as well as be available to facilitate referral for additional BH care when needed.
4. Tailor resources and support as much as is feasible – and plan on changing/adapting resources with the unfolding realities of the medical mission. Flexibility is important.
Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 57
      
Clinical Management of COVID-19
5. Supportive care of healthcare workers is different from usual clinical care, and includes:
a. Check in with the physicians, nurses, technicians, and support staff, and get to know their mission and
challenges in a non-intrusive manner.
b. Link with support services, such as Red Cross, providing food and beverages.
c. Provide information on normal stress reactions and adaptive responses.
d. Promote positive peer support and facilitate connections.
e. Make connections during a calm time. Do not interrupt urgent patient care or sign-out.
f. Offer combinations of simple supportive non-clinical strategies, as well as clinical triage when appropriate
(e.g. find a quiet space to talk when things are chaotic).
g. Ensure individuals have access to safe spaces and emotional/spiritual support.
6. Unique issues to consider when supporting frontline workers:
a. Be aware of the potential for distress related to ethical issues in providers making difficult and potentially
life or death triage and management decisions.
b. Be aware of potential concerns of individual front line workers, including single parents, dual healthcare
worker families, families with serious medical issues, workers living separate from their families, and
individuals facing the community stigma of being “infected.

REHABILITATION CONCERNS FOR PERSONS WITH COVID-19
Rehabilitation of COVID-19 Patients and PUIs
Overview.
1. This document is intended to provide guidance and planning considerations for the provision of acute and critical care rehabilitation for hospitalized patients by practicing acute care Physical Therapy (PT) and Occupational Therapy (OT) providers and augmented staff dedicated to support the COVID-19 response.
2. The goal of acute care inpatient rehabilitation is to improve mobility in order to reduce mortality, decrease hospital length of stay (LOS), decrease ICU and ventilator days, streamline patient throughput, and decrease the burden of acute rehabilitation after discharge.
3. Early rehabilitation involvement in the facility’s COVID-19 planning team is recommended to anticipate rehabilitation needs.
4. Rehabilitation personnel should be dedicated to either COVID-19 patients or non-COVID-19 patients to minimize potential exposure.
5. Pool staff resources as able and maximize distancing. Maintaining appropriate work/rest cycles.
6. Screening tools should be used to quantitatively determine a patient’s need for therapy intervention.
ICU and Critical Care Staffing ratio recommendations when respiratory rehabilitations is a primary intervention
1. ICU recommendations: 4 therapy providers for the first 22 ICU beds. One FTE for each 4-bed increase.
2. Acute Care Recommendations: therapy provider FTE for the first 11 beds and a potential increase of 2 per
additional 11 beds.
3. Subacute and Acute Inpatient Rehabilitation Unit (if present): 2.5 FTEs per 11 beds.
4. Staffing ratios may be lower when rehabilitation interventions are the primary focus rather than on
respiratory rehabilitation
Personal Protective Equipment
1. Prior to working with patients with COVID-19, therapy staff should have comprehensive training on the use of PPE.
Treatment Guidelines
1. Positioning: Rehabilitation staff may be involved in prone positioning with COVID-19 patients due to their expertise in safely and optimally performing this task.
Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 58
     
Clinical Management of COVID-19
2. Rehabilitation should progress to active movement as soon as possible.
3. Provide patient specific exercise programs and handouts.
4. Partner with nursing for patient active participation in care and exercise.
5. Interactions with COVID-19 patients will be limited to a contained environment where airborne precautions
can be maintained.
6. Therapy staff must have advanced understanding of medical implications of COVID-19
7. Emphasize treatment of non-COVID-19 patients for quick discharge to decrease risk of exposure.
8. Attend to the well-being of the whole patient by promoting orientation and communication with patient
during therapy sessions.
Discharge Planning
1. Goal should be safe patient discharge to home from the acute hospital setting whenever possible.
2. Therapists should participate in multidisciplinary rounding/discharge planning to ensure necessary patient
supports are in place for discharge.
3. Electronic communication with spouses and other care providers should be completed to promote patient and
family confidence in the discharge plan

TELEMEDICINE SUPPORT DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
1. Telemedicine, also referred to as virtual health (VH), encompasses a set of tools that leverage information and communication technologies to most commonly extend medical care across geographic distances and boundaries. These same tools have a significant and unique potential to support care delivery during an infectious pandemic in order to decrease healthcare worker exposure to contagion (i.e. “clinical distancing”), reduce the usage of consumable PPE, while also enabling continued medical care delivery for non-infected patients while in their home. Accordingly, the CDC now recommends the liberal use of telehealth during the COVID19 Pandemic (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/healthcare- facilities/guidance-hcf.html).
2. Telemedicine can be delivered through two primary manners
a. Direct-to-patient VH. Services delivered in this manner require credentialing and privileging IAW DHA
PM 6025.13 using the centralized privileging by proxy for telemedicine (TPbP) through the Virtual Medical Center. A provider or a patient can be in the home for a telemedicine visit. Direct-to-Patient VH is most appropriate when a provider is directly evaluating a patient, and requires documentation of the encounter in the electronic health record (EHR).
b. Tele-Consultation. Services delivered in this manner may occur without separate privileging at the patient’s location, and typically are performed from healthcare professional to healthcare professional (i.e. trained clinician to trained clinician like medic to remote physician or nurse to physician or physician to physician).
3. Telemedicine technology:
a. Phone calls can be used for a majority of patient encounters during the COVID Pandemic. The need for
clinical video versus telephone and/or secure messaging will be based upon the provider’s individual
judgement, and will take into consideration the specific patient complaint evaluated.
b. Clinicians engaging in telemedicine (especially forums that utilize video with the patient) must
appreciate the burden it places upon valuable network resources. The solution that achieves clinical
needs and uses the minimal network resources should be utilized when possible.
4. All care provided through telemedicine should be documented in the appropriate EHR. If the provider is
delivering care from outside of the MTF, the DHA Application Virtualization Hosting Environment (AVHE) can be utilized to access the EHR.
       Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 59

Clinical Management of COVID-19
a. AVHE can be accessed from a computer with a CAC-card reader through the following URL: https://avhe.health.mil.
b. Make sure to select your email certificate
5. There are several use-cases for telemedicine during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Each require planning and
practice to be successful.
6. Use cases for which currently available MHS approved solutions exist include:
 a.
Screening and Initial Evaluation (e.g. Virtual Clinics)
i. Phone calls can be used for a majority of patient encounters during the CoVID Pandemic. The need
for clinical video versus telephone and/or secure messaging will be based upon the provider’s individual judgement, and will take into consideration the specific patient complaint that is being evaluated.
ii. Web-portal based screening tools suggest need for patients to engage with their healthcare system (reduces overall burden on the system if patients are screened as low risk). Some examples of online tools are listed below, although none are created or owned by the DOD:
a) https://c19check.com/start. Site hosted by Emory University Medical Center, which provides
likelihood of CoVID infection based on answering series of online questions.
b) https://penn-chime.phl.io/ Site hosted by Penn State Medical Center, Predictive Healthcare
Team, which provides patient volume projections during the pandemic.
iii. Asynchronous solutions including web-portal based messaging (e.g. Relay Health and MHS
GENESIS patient portal) and e-mail allow engagement with the healthcare system with minimal
network resource use.
iv. Where available, portable telemedicine units can be employed by triage and Emergency
Department personnel to evaluate patients to reduce clinician exposure to potentially sick patients; Telehealth in a Bag (THIAB), Transportable Exam Station (TES), and Video Teleconferencing (VTC) Carts with/without virtual exam equipment.
v. These systems can connect a patient (within an isolation setting) to a provider (within a “clean” setting) by use of either portable data networks (PDN’s), WiFi routers, cellular service, or hospital WiFi networks.
vi. Synchronous video to the patient’s location can be accomplished through several mechanisms. The preferred and supported solutions are Adobe Connect and Cisco Meeting Server (more below).
Inpatient Wards (non-ICU)
i. Where available, portable telemedicine units can be employed by triage and Emergency
Department personnel to evaluate patients; Telehealth in a Bag (THIAB), Transportable Exam Station
(TES), and Video Teleconferencing (VTC) Carts.
ii. These systems can connect a patient (within an isolation setting) to a provider (within a “clean”
setting) by use of either portable data networks (PDN’s), WiFi routers, cellular service, or hospital
WiFi networks.

a)
Sites that are currently enrolled in the Joint Tele-Critical Care Network, should use this existing resource to support care of critically ill patients with or without suspected / confirmed COVID-19. Sites that are not currently enrolled in JTCCN, should attempt triage and management of patients as outlined in this document and per usual standards of care. For hospitals that typically do not care for critically ill patients, this may involve transfer of the patient to a local civilian hospital.
MTFs that are not enrolled in the JTCCN that (1) do not have sufficient critical care expertise, and (2) cannot transfer critically ill patients, may be forced to care for these patients. In this situation, tele-consultation is available to support clinicians.
Tele-consultation can be obtained through either:

d. Virtual Health to Patient Location (e.g. home)
i. The CDC recommends providing outpatient care where/when possible through telemedicine to minimize infectious exposure in MTFs for at risk patients and staff.
ii. Virtual health to patient location can be established through several mechanisms.
a) Secure Messaging (e.g. Relay Health, MHS GENESIS Patient Portal).
b) Establishing a clinic cell phone with texting services and publishing the number
c) Using phone calls to discuss patient problems/symptoms as indicated.
d) Conducting Synchronous Video Visits can be performed through either Adobe Connect or Cisco Meeting Server (preferred solutions), or through several non-public facing communication platforms.
 Adobe Connect accounts can be requested from the VMC Front Office at:
https://info.health.mil/army/VMC/IT/Lists/AdobeConnectRequest/Item/newifs.aspx?Source
=https://info.health.mil/army/VMC
 Online VH training must be completed prior to Adobe Connect account creation. The DHA Virtual Health Provider Training (US444) can be found on the JKO training website: https://jkodirect.jten.mil.
 Additional guidance will be forthcoming IRT the Cisco Meeting Server capability. The capability being established by DHA J6 will have several interconnected servers spread across the enterprise.
 The following non-public facing communications tools are authorized for provider-patient medical interactions, however these technologies are not supported by the DHA or DOD.
 Apple FaceTime  Google Duo
 Microsoft Skype
e. OCONUS MTFs may utilize existing asynchronous virtual health platforms (PATH for INDOPACOM, HELP for EUCOM, AFRICOM, and CENTCOM) to obtain teleconsultation subspecialty consultation.
7. Documentation, Billing, and Coding (See Appendix N)
   a. b. c.
When direct-to-patient telemedicine is performed, encounters should be documented in the appropriate electronic medical record (AHTLA or Genesis for outpatients, Essentris of Genesis for inpatients).
If the Military Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) is open and conducting normal clinical operations, no change in coding is necessary.
If the MTF is open, but is restricting access for patients who can be treated virtually, the processes are as follows:
i. By telephone only:
a) Document as normal for the appropriate encounter type (not in t-con module) to include
history, any counseling, assessment and plan, and disposition. Include time spent during the
encounter, if required, by service performed.
b) Assign the diagnoses, as appropriate.
c) Assign G2012 in the procedure (Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System [HCPCS]) code
section.
d) Assign E/M 99499 or leave blank.
ii. By synchronous visual and audio telecommunications:
a) Document as normal for the appropriate encounter type to include history, exam if done, any
counseling, assessment and plan, and disposition. Include time spent during encounter if
required by service performed.
b) Assign the diagnoses, as appropriate.
c) Assign any procedures performed and documented (e.g., psychotherapy, PHQ-9, etc.)
Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 62

Clinical Management of COVID-19
d) Assign appropriate Evaluation and Management (E/M) service, if performed; otherwise assign 99499 or leave blank.
e) Apply virtual encounter modifier to encounter (GT=MTF to MTF or 95=provider to patient location other than an MTF).
8. Other Considerations:
a. Always be conscious of the need to maintain patient privacy and data security and clearly delineate
risks to the patient or healthcare professionals using the system.
b. Do NOT use photos, video, geospatial positions when you are in an operationally sensitive area:
ALWAYS CONSIDER OPSEC!
c. Before pursuing a new application of telehealth, CLEARLY DEFINE YOUR USE CASE, then consider
technology resources (hardware, software, and network combinations) that can be used for your use case. Most importantly, consider HOW you will use the technology and practice this workflow before implementing it broadly at your location. Consider the following:
i. Who will use your solution?
ii. Why would they use your solution?
iii. When would they use this solution?
iv. Where will they use the solution (in a patient room, at a nursing station, from a home/office, to
a home/office, etc.)?
v. What combination of hardware, software, and network will be used?
vi. How will they use it (training, how-to guides, etc.)
1. How will they document care?
2. How will you maintain patient regulation (admission/discharge/transfer)?
3. How will you maintain team-based care as necessary?
d. PRACTICE your solution on a small scale before deploying more broadly.
e. Establish routine communication with leadership regarding current capabilities and your telehealth
solution’s potential to off-load aspects of bedside care to telemedicine support. Use telemedicine to triage bedside clinician time and activities. Necessary to do this is good communication and trust between the bedside clinical team and the remote clinical team. One way to facilitate this is to rotate teams from bedside duties to telemedicine duties or to shift infected caregivers toward telemedicine and recovered caregivers towards the bedside. Importantly, asking/having all clinicians participate in telemedicine increases their awareness and understanding of telemedicine capabilities and limitations.
9. Questions regarding MTF and Market telemedicine capabilities should be directed to MTF and Market virtual health leads. Questions that cannot be answered by the MTF/Market VH lead, or questions pertains to an enterprise VH service, should be directed to the regional VMC hub site.
a. CONUS: VMC-C located in San Antonio
b. INDOPACOM: VMC-IP located in San Diego, CA
c. EUROPE: VMC-E located in Landstuhl, Germany
EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES (EMS) AND GROUND TRANSPORT OF PERSONS WITH COVID-19
Dispatch Screening for COVID-19
1. Persons assigned to EMS and first responder dispatch function should complete key question interrogation and dispatch resources accordingly. Dispatchers should reference the EMS COVID-19 questionnaire when obtaining information from 911 callers (Table 9). EMS systems may become strained due to an influx of 911 calls regarding known or suspected COVID-19 transmission or infection. In areas where EMS resources are overwhelmed by 911 call volumes, the following should be considered:
a. EMS and/or Fire Dispatch should triage 911 calls and prioritize responses accordingly (e.g. if a patient calls reporting signs and symptoms consistent with COVID-19, but denies respiratory distress and other complaints suggestive of a life-threatening condition (i.e. chest pain, etc.), ambulance services should be directed to an alternative, higher- acuity call.
  Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 63

Clinical Management of COVID-19
b. If EMS arrives on scene and determines that a patient does not have a life-threatening condition relating to the potential exposure to, or signs and symptoms of, COVID-19, EMS crews should contact On-line Medical Control to discuss non-transport and/or alternative transport destinations. If non-transport is approved, EMS Dispatch should direct the EMS crew to a higher-acuity 911 call. Refusal of Transport /Treat and Release should be coordinated with local On-line Medical Control
c. Callers using the 911 system for questions or concerns regarding COVID-19 testing (e.g. sites, locations, and decisions regarding testing criteria) should be diverted to established local, county, or state COVID-19 call centers. Installations and facilities should consult with their local EMS Medical Directors regarding protocols and policies pertaining to call diversion for information-only requests from 911 callers.
Pre-Arrival Screening or Initial Patient Assessment of Suspected COV-19 Patients. (For utilization by EMS/Fire Department Dispatch OR Responding Crews)
1. Initial assessment from at least six feet away if patient presentation allows. If the patient reports symptoms consistent with a respiratory illness, EMS personnel should don appropriate PPE. With widespread COVID-19 prevalence, all patients should have a surgical-type mask on the patient (best) [or other mask type, e.g., cloth (better)].
2. If the patient’s condition allows, to minimize the risk of exposure, one individual should approach the patient, placea surgical-type mask on him/her, and complete the COVID-19 screening questionnaire/ initial assessment. Additional EMS/Fire personnel should be contacted for support only as required.
3. If EMS personnel are first on-scene, and it is determined that the patient has symptoms of a respiratory illness (Box 1) and risk factors for COVID-19 (Box 2), Dispatch should be contacted to minimize response by additional units (Fire and Law Enforcement) to reduce the risk of exposure.
EMS Non-Transport/Treat on Scene
1. Purpose: Identify patients that do not require EMS transport to a hospital or alternate facility during the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to accomplish the following: 1) Minimize disease transmission to the community and health care system; 2) Protect first responders and health care providers and; 3) Preserve the health care system functionality by not overwhelming emergency resources.
2. Transport decision and final destination versus non-transport with self-care should be considered by EMS Medical Directors, partnering with MTF leadership, to develop local policies. The following are provided as recommendations:
a. Careful consideration for EMS Non-Transport should be given for pediatric patients, pregnant females, or
patients who are immunocompromised. Discussion with Online Medical Control is advised.
b. The below assessment tool is to inform the necessity to transport an adult patient when the patient
reports symptoms related to COVID-19.
c. If a patient is not transported, he/she should be directed to contact 911 if he/she develops significant
shortness of breath, chest pain, the inability to tolerate oral intake, or is unable to schedule follow-up with an appropriate health care provider/facility.
Table 9. Emergency Medical System/First Responder Pre-Arrival Screening for COVID-19
Does the patient have:
BOX 1
 Fever (or are they hot to the touch)
 Cough
 Shortness of Breathing or Difficulty Breathing
 Other flu-like symptoms (sore throat, runny nose,
body aches, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or anosmia/dysgeusia)
         AND
 
BOX 2
Are they currently under investigation or isolation for COVID- 19 by public health or other medical professionals?
Have they been in close contact with an individual who is known to be sick with, or under public health/medical professional investigation/isolation for COVID-19?
    If the patient meets at least one criteria item from Box 1 and Box 2, see below:
Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 64
 
Clinical Management of COVID-19
 Instruct the individual to isolate him/herself from close contact with others until EMS arrives.
 Notify First Responders (to include Fire and Law Enforcement) that the patient meets pre- arrival screening criteria for COVID-
19. Advise donning of appropriate PPE prior to patient contact.
 Follow local agency policies to limit multi-unit responses.
 Transport Agencies will contact the receiving facility as soon as possible, preferably prior to transport (See EMS TRANSPORT OF
PERSONS UNDER INVESTIGATION OR PATIENTS WITH CONFIRMED COVID-19).

EMS Transport in Resource-Limited Environments.
1. During the pandemic, MTFs and civilian EMS services may become inundated with critically ill patients, exceeding MTF treatment and transport capabilities. It is strongly recommended that EMS Medical Directors partner with MTF leadership to discuss disaster response contingency plans relating to inter-facility transports. Nationally Registered Paramedics (NRPs), with approval and guidance from local EMS Medical Directors, are authorized to transport critically ill patients via ambulance. The following are ambulance staffing recommendations to be utilized according to staffing capabilities and patient acuity:
     If the patient:
is not ventilated and has no more than two intravenous (IV) or intraosseous (IO) pump infused medications
is not ventilated and has ≥3 IV/IO pump infused meds
is ventilated and has ≤2 IV/IO pump infused meds is ventilated and has ≥3 IV/IO pump infused meds
is ventilated and has three or more IV/IO pump infused medications
GOOD
Crew (in addition to the EMT/NRP driver):
Paramedic
Paramedic AND Critical Care Registered Nurse (CCRN) OR Certified Emergency Nurse (CEN)
Paramedic x 2 OR  Paramedic AND Respiratory Therapist (RT) Paramedic x 2 AND CCRN OR CEN OR Paramedic, RT, AND CCRN OR CEN
If NRPs are unavailable, consider utilizing MTF CCAT Teams OR hybrid transport teams consisting of a CCRN, Critical Care Technician and a RT. All patient transports should have 2 EMTs on board to assist with ambulance operations.
BETTER
                If the patient: Crew (in addition to the EMT/NRP driver): References:

Clinical Management of COVID-19
       ventilated with IV/IO infusion medication, but no central lines or arterial lines
is ventilated with central line, or arterial line, or chest tube
Above criteria AND complex ventilator settings OR
> 4 IV/IO infusions
If the patient: requires critical care
NRP trained in ventilator management
ABG should be obtained within 30 minutes of transport. If time allows, patient should be placed on transport ventilator for at least 15 minutes prior to transport.
At least 2 providers trained at the NRP level or above (physician (MD/DO), physician’s assistant (PA), nurse practitioner (NP), or registered nurse (RN))
Primary care provider requirement:
> 3 years ED, ICU, or critical care experience.
Above requirements AND 1 crew member must be an RN with Certified Flight RN, Critical Care RN, or Certified Transport Registered Nurse within 2 years of hire, or equivalent national certification.

                         Crew (in addition to the driver):
Military or civilian trained and equipped critical care transport crew (Ground, Rotary, or Fixed Wing)
    2. Additional considerations for interfacility transport include:
a. On-line Medical Control. On-line Medical Control must be available to transport critically ill patients.
b. Training. Personnel involved in interfacility transports should be trained on ambulances, facility transport
ventilators, infusion pumps and all required equipment. Additionally, NRPs with critical care training: Critical Care Paramedic Program (CCEMT-P), Certified Critical Care Paramedics (C-CCPs), Certified Flight Paramedics (FP-Cs), or individuals with previous critical care experience should be tasked as primary transport personnel given their increased education/experience.
c. Ventilators. NRPs and RNs should be deemed proficient in ventilator operation and management by the local EMS Medical Director prior to performing patient transport. Ventilated patients should be transported with physician documented orders which detail ventilator settings. All patients will be monitored with wave-form capnography. If a BVM is utilized for transport, or if use of the BVM becomes necessary during transport, a positive-end expiratory pressure (PEEP) valve must be applied and dialed to the ventilator PEEP setting. Ventilators and BVMs should be equipped with HEPA filters.
d. Intravenous/intraosseous Infusions. Many pre-hospital NRP infusions are currently delivered without the use of an infusion pump (epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, amiodarone, and magnesium sulfate), however any infusion for an interfacility transfer should be on an infusion pump. Medications not detailed in the formulary outlined by EMS protocols are authorized with a written physician order. Orders should specify the name of the medication, the drug concentration, and the infusion rate. Infusions must be initiated by the sending facility. Infusions will be maintained at the physician-prescribed dosing regimen. Alterations to dosing regimens require authorization from a physician, preferably, On-line Medical Control. Rapid deterioration in patient clinical status negates the requirement for physician authorization (e.g. vasopressor titration).
e. Prior to placing a transport request, MTF in-patient units should communicate with local EMS Medical Directors or attending Emergency Department physicians to determine transport capabilities. If possible, patient documentation (to include compact discs containing images) should be prepared prior to transport crew arrival.
3. Prior to placing a transport request, MTF in-patient units should communicate with local EMS Medical Directors or attending Emergency Department physicians to determine transport capabilities. If possible,
Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 66

Clinical Management of COVID-19
patient documentation (to include compact discs containing images) should be prepared prior to transport crew arrival.
4. If trained healthcare personnel are severely limited, local Medical Directors should partner with MTF and Logistics leadership to discuss the use of licensed drivers/ government owned vehicles to transport of low acuity patients.
EMS Personnel Precautions for Procedures.
1. See CDC guidance for aerosol generating procedures: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019- ncov/hcp/guidance-for-ems.html.
2. If patient presentation allows, EMS personnel providing care to a patient suspected of having COVID-19 should contact Medical Control and/or follow protocol before initiating an aerosol-generating procedure.
3. Nebulized medications for known or suspected COVID-19 patients should be limited given the risk of virus transmission. It is recommended that local Medical Directors work with MTF leadership to obtain single-use albuterol metered-dose inhalers with spacers for prehospital use. If an aerosol-generating procedure is required/recommended, the doors to the patient compartment of the ambulance should remain open to allow ventilation of the area during these procedures. If the ambulance is equipped with an HVAC system it should remain on during patient transport.
4. If used, BVMs, SGAs, and ET tubes should have a HEPA/viral filter attached. If the EMS agency has access to ventilators, units should contact the specific ventilator manufacturer for additional guidelines and to obtain part numbers for compatible HEPA/viral filters.
Mechanical CPR.
1. The American College of Cardiology’s recommendation to use mechanical CPR devices on PUIs or patients with confirmed COVID-19 who arrest (https://www.acc.org/latest-in- cardiology/articles/2020/03/19/13/14/cvd-in-the-setting-of-covid-19-coronavirus-considerations-to- prepare-patients-providers-health-systems). See updated AHA ACLS and PALS Cardiac Arrest Algorithms for best practice for COVID-19 patients (April 2020). (https://professional.heart.org)
2. Local Medical Directors & EMS/Fire Leadership are responsible for ensuring personnel education of device indications/contraindications, application, and cleaning, which should be documented in training records.
3. Devices should be cleaned according to CDC recommendations for known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
4. Contact the device manufacturer for additional recommendations.
Cleaning EMS Transport Vehicles After Transporting a PUI or Patient with Confirmed COVID-19: See current CDC guidelines: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-for-ems.html
Follow-up for EMS Personnel after Caring for a PUI or Patient with Confirmed COVID-19.
1. Local public health and infectious disease authorities should be notified about the patient so that appropriate follow-up monitoring can occur.
2. EMS personnel who have been exposed to a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should notify their chain of command to ensure appropriate follow-up.
3. EMS agencies should develop local policies for assessing exposure risk and the management of EMS personnel potentially exposed to COVID-19. Decisions for monitoring and quarantine should be made in consultation with public health and infectious disease authorities.
4. EMS personnel should be alert for fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough, shortness of breath, sore throat). If symptoms develop, it is recommended that they self-isolate and notify their public health authority to arrange for evaluation.
EN ROUTE CRITICAL CARE CONSIDERATIONS FOR PERSONS WITH COVID-19
1. The DoD has issued a COVID-19 specific Force Health Protection Guidance (Supplement 5) to DoDI 6000.11 “Patient Movement.” Attachment 1 of this supplement provides guidance for the air movement of COVID-19
Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 67
         
Clinical Management of COVID-19
patients and COVID-19 exposed persons. “Treatment in Place” remains the primary guidance. The document (https://www.whs.mil/Portals/75/Coronavirus/FHP%20Guidance%20(Supplement%205)%20- %20DoD%20Guidance%20for%20Mvmt.%20and%20Med.%20Treatment.pdf?ver=2020-04-08-142257-760) discusses procedures for obtaining an exception to policy, preferred means of transport, airframe selection, biocontainment, cabin airflow, patient placement, and infection control. It also discusses specific safety precaution considerations regarding mechanical ventilators, clinical specimen management, waste disposal, aircraft cleaning, logistical planning, and in-flight emergencies. Repeating the document is not an intent of this guidance. Medical planners and clinicians are strongly encouraged to review FHP 5 when considering transport for patients with COVID-19.
2. The following suggested treatment plans exist for Critical Care Air Transport (CCAT) teams transporting critically ill COVID-19 patients under an ETP. This section highlights considerations for flight. CCAT team members should review the relevant critical care topics elsewhere in this PMG.
3. Biocontainment: Civil Aviation Assets (e.g., Phoenix Air Group) should be the primary means of patient movement if capable. For USAF CCAT or aeromedical evacuation (AE) teams tasked to transport patients on USAF aircraft, the best practice is to use a biocontainment module like the DoD’s transport isolation system (TIS), followed by transport in open aircraft. AMC has issued AMC COVID-19 PMP, which discusses best practices for transport in open aircraft and offers guidance on appropriate PPE measures. FHP Supplement 5 discusses these measures as well.
4. Initial assessment: The pre-evacuation assessment requires additional time due to the complexity of these patients. Consider continuing to treat in place those not requiring mechanical ventilation or depleting local resources in austere locations. In environments with fewer resource constraints, consider allowing patients to declare themselves on the ground to require mechanical ventilation before transport. Teleconsultation over time may assist in the management of non-ventilated patients and help determine the need for mechanical ventilation before transport.
5. Neurologic: Sedation can be challenging in the controlled environment of the ICU and even more complicated in flight. Adjust management to conserve common medications in short supply. Reports indicate a ceiling dose of propofol (30 mcg/kg/min), with little effect of increasing infusions. Consider combinations of acetaminophen (IV/PO), opiates (gtts/IVP/PO), propofol (gtts), atypical antipsychotics (IV/IM/PO), and sub- dissociative ketamine (IV) for a multi-modal approach to patient analgesia/sedation. Use caution with dexmedetomidine due to reports of significant bradycardia. Utilize low dose benzodiazepines (IVP) as a last resort due to their association with delirium and prolonged mechanical ventilation. Continue the same or a more aggressive analgesia/sedation strategy for flight if a patient is receiving neuromuscular blockade.
6. Pulmonary: Anecdotal evidence suggests a subset of COVID-19 patients whose hypoxia rapidly corrects with awake proning and supplemental oxygen. Additionally, anecdotal evidence indicates some patients fare poorly with early intubation. Therefore, the traditional CCAT practice of intubation solely for the flight may not be appropriate. CCAT team leads must consider the difficulty in predicting when COVID-19 patients will deteriorate, and anticipate a need for in-flight intubation. Plan patient placement and airflow characteristics on the aircraft to minimize aircraft/crew exposure in case of in-flight intubation. Patients with persistent respiratory distress, complaints of dyspnea, persistent hypoxia with SpO2 <92%, or a pH of <7.2 despite preflight proning and conventional supplemental oxygen likely indicate a need for intubation. Careful observation during flight and avoiding intubation may be appropriate for patients whose symptoms improve with awake proning and supplemental oxygen. Consider using the low PEEP table for intubated patients with a low driving pressure (Pplat – PEEP) and 6-8 ml/kg IBW tidal volume. Conversely, for patients with moderate to severe ARDS and less compliant lungs with a higher driving pressure, consider using the high PEEP table.
Cabin Altitude Restriction (CAR): Consider a CAR when transporting non-intubated patients requiring supplemental oxygen or intubated patients on high PEEP or high FiO2 in anticipation of potential in-flight patient decompensation. During pre-mission planning, the CCATT lead should discuss a CAR with the TPRMC validating flight surgeon. A lower CAR is associated with a longer duration of the flight. A sea-level CAR can provide an increased safety buffer if the aircraft is capable.
  Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 68

Clinical Management of COVID-19
Prone Positioning: Strongly consider lung team consultation before transporting intubated patients in the prone position or patients requiring PEEP >14, FiO2 >60%. For intubated patients that are to be transported in the prone position, initiate prone positioning preflight with adequate time (i.e., >4 hours or physician discretion) to verify patient stability and adequate ABG. After proning, wean FiO2 to maintain SpO2 >92%. Ideally, design a patient load strategy allowing access for bilateral chest tubes placement, particularly when utilizing high PEEP. Prone positioning complicates the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, pneumothorax, and shock. Before proning, consider placing cardioversion pads for dysrhythmia treatment. Leave the patient on the ventilator to avoid additional aerosolized particles during cardiac arrest. Consider CPR in the prone position during cardiac arrest (see AHA 2010 guidelines). Avoid rotation (proning/reversal) of intubated patients during flight. Refer to Appendix C for further discussion of prone positioning. It highlights the need for thorough patient handoff preflight. Be aware prone positioning requires frequent repositioning and padding to prevent pressure wounds. Prone-positioned patients may have intermittent scheduled times in a supine position. Cautiously consider patient movement during the supine period, as FiO2 requirements usually increase upon supination and may continue to increase throughout the supine period.
Refer to Appendix H for a demonstration of the transport ventilator setup.
Table 11 shows the required FiO2 to maintain a constant PaO2 at different altitudes. It may be useful when
assessing stability for flight and the need for cabin altitude restriction. Table 11. Altitude Physiology Table
7. Cardiovascular: Optimize electrolytes (e.g., Ca, Mg, and K) preflight due to the incidence of tachydysrhythmias. Consider requesting electrolyte supplementation preflight due to the allowance standard limitations. Review the EKG. Consider holding QTc prolonging medications (e.g., chloroquine derivatives, antipsychotics, etc.) if the QTc >500 ms. Due to the incidence of cardiomyopathy, obtain an echo preflight to inform treatment if in-flight shock develops. For intubated patients, place a CVC preflight, in case a vasopressor requirement develops during the flight.
8. Renal: AKI is common in COVID-19 patients. Renally adjust medication dosage and convert renally metabolized medications as appropriate (e.g., morphine -> dilaudid, or lovenox -> heparin).
9. Gastrointestinal: Continue stress ulcer prophylaxis. Continue post-pyloric enteric feeds, as suggested in Appendix K. OGT should be placed preflight and on intermittent suction.
10. Fluids: Euvolemia is the goal. If hypovolemia is suspected, consider low volume (250–500ml) boluses of balanced crystalloid solutions. Anticipate K and Mg replacement need if patient diuresis is ongoing. Recall potassium is not in the CCATT allowance standard.
11. Heme: Ensure administration of DVT prophylaxis. Anecdotal evidence suggests some COVID-19 patients are affected by pulmonary microvascular thrombosis. Guidance for treatment is not within the realm of this section of the PMG. Recommend discussion with sending/receiving critical care specialists to determine the dose of prophylactic anticoagulation.
12. Non-COVID-19 patient transports may continue within the PM system. Utilize standard transmission-based precautions in accordance with AFI 48-307. Movements should be requested when it is essential to provide appropriate care while minimizing opportunities for transmission of pathogens within and between theaters and countries.

PHEO responsibilities fall into 10 major categories, including: advising the military commander regarding the declaration of a public health emergency and the implementation of emergency health powers, assisting in public affairs risk communications, including dissemination of health protection measures detailed in the Health Protection Condition (HPCON) framework in coordination with the Public Affairs Officer, coordinating with other DoD Components, civilian state, legal, tribal, and territories (SLTT), other federal agencies, and others.
c. Declaring a Public Health Emergency (PHE): Commanders must be prepared to make timely decisions in order to protect lives, property, and infrastructure and enable DoD installations and/or military commands to sustain mission-critical operations and essential services. Declaration of a PHE allows the installation commander access to the medical emergency powers described in DoDI 6200.03, including restriction of movement (ROM), directing examinations and testing, and controlling or restricting the distribution of commodities, and others. The process by which the Commander makes decision to declare a PHE is summarized in the DoDI.
d. Health Protection Condition (HPCON) levels are used during a health emergency to communicate what health protection measures are currently being used to prevent the spread of disease in the population. The decision to adjust HPCON posture is not based on strictly objective criteria - rather, it is based on a constellation of factors. These factors are similar to deciding whether to declare a Public Health Emergency. The decision to adjust HPCON levels may be more political than one driven by public health statistics. If the public health recommendations are being mostly followed with few exceptions, and the command continues to support public health interventions as they are needed, then the specific HPCON level is less
(from a strictly public health perspective) relevant. For example:
i. Evidence of repeated noncompliance with public health guidance among the installation community.
ii. Difficulties in getting supervisors and/or employees to follow public health guidelines for example,
regarding guidance on returning to work.
iii. Any difficulties encountered by public health personnel in conducting duties required to investigate a
public health threat, e.g. a case investigation and contact tracing.
iv. A sense from commanders that the installation community is panicking, or is on the verge of panic.
e. Further information on HPCONs can be found in the DODI and at:
https://phc.amedd.army.mil/topics/campaigns/covid19/Pages/HPCON.aspx

https://www.health.mil/Training-Center/Defense-Medical-Readiness-Training-Institute/Public-Health-
Emergency-Management-Course
2. Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are critical when no vaccine or therapeutic is available to mitigate a public health threat. NPIs directed towards control of COVID-19, for example, were largely based on the CDC’s “Community Mitigation Guidelines to Prevent Pandemic Influenza—United States, 2017,” at: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/rr/rr6601a1.htm. These include:
i ii iii iv
      a. Personal Protective Measures (PPMs) for Everyday Use
 . Voluntary home isolation (i.e., staying home when ill or self-isolation)
. Respiratory etiquette
. In health care settings, screening for respiratory symptoms immediately upon entry.
. Hand hygiene
 b. Personal Protective Measures (PPMs) Reserved for Pandemics. During a pandemic, the PPMs described above should be strengthened and augmented with additional measures:

iv. Preemptive or reactive school and work closures/dismissals.
v. Elimination or reduction of other mass gatherings.
vi. Social/physical distancing measures to no less than 6 feet separation.
vii. Environmental surface cleaning measures in all settings.
3. Contact tracing (also called contact investigation): When a person gets sick, they are interviewed by public health personnel to make a contact list of other individuals who they might have exposed. The steps include:
a. Contact identification: Each case of COVID‐19 is interviewed to identify contacts (people) and activities
starting 2 days before symptoms started.
b. Contact notification: All contacts are notified that they may have been exposed to COVID‐19.
c. Contact follow‐up: Regular follow‐up may be needed with all contacts to monitor for symptoms and provide
additional information about COVID‐19.
PLEASE NOTE! Contact tracing is very time consuming and requires large amount of man power! Therefore, force multiplying protocols were developed to train nonmedical individuals to assist in the process. Additional information on contact tracing, including a toolkit for contact tracing, can be found at: https://phc.amedd.army.mil/topics/campaigns/covid19/Pages/healthcare.aspx
4. Risk assessment for potential COVID-19 exposures:
a. Travel exposures: Includes travel from a country with widespread ongoing transmission (currently includes
all countries), or travel on cruise ship or river boat. Public health actions include (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/risk-assessment.html): (1) Stay home until 14 days after arrival and maintain a distance of at least 6 feet (2 m) from others; (2) Self-monitor for symptoms and check temperature twice a day; (3) Avoid contact with people at higher risk for severe illness; and (4) Follow CDC guidance if symptoms develop.
b. Community-based exposures (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/public-health- recommendations.html):
i. Applies to: Household members, intimate partners, individuals providing care in a household without using recommended infection control precautions, and Individuals who have had close contact (< 6 feet) for a prolonged period of time
ii. Exposure to:
iii. Public health actions: same as under “travel exposures” above
c. Health care worker exposures (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-risk-assesment-
hcp.html). Healthcare facilities should consider foregoing contact tracing for exposures in a healthcare setting in favor of universal source control for all healthcare personnel and screening for fever and symptoms before every shift.
i. High risk exposures r
 Active, rapid identification of persons having symptoms consistent with COVID-19, followed by referral
 for testing and home isolation.
 Identification and home quarantine of non-ill household members or other close contacts of persons
 with COVID-19. See “contact tracing” section below.
 Use of face masks or cloth face coverings by well persons. IMPORTANT NOTE: respirators (e.g. N95,
 PAPR) are medical supplies and are reserved for use by at-risk medical providers. See information

            until meets criteria for discontinuing home isolation
  (can be a laboratory-confirmed disease or a clinically compatible illness in a state or territory with
  widespread community transmission)
    Proper adherence to currently recommended infection control practices,
 including all recommended PPE, should protect HCP having prolonged close contact with patients infected
 with COVID-19. However, to account for any inconsistencies in use or adherence that could result in
 unrecognized exposures, HCP should still perform self-monitoring with delegated supervision.

i. Test-based strategy. Exclude from work until:
a) Resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and
b) Improvement in respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath), and
c) Negative results of an FDA Emergency Use Authorized molecular assay for COVID-19 from at least
two consecutive nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected ≥24 hours apart (total of two negative
specimens)
ii. Non-test-based strategy. Exclude from work until:
a) At least 3 days (72 hours) have passed since recovery defined as resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and improvement in respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath); and
b) At least 7 days have passed since symptoms first appeared
b. Return to work criteria for HCP: The test-based strategy or the non-test-based strategy (aka symptom-based
strategy) above may be used with the following differences:
i. HCP with symptoms may use either strategy, but if using the symptom-based strategy, they should be
excluded from work until 10 days have passed since symptoms appeared
ii. HCP without symptoms may use the test-based strategy or a time-based strategy, in which HCP are
excluded from work until 10 days have passed since the date of their first positive COVID-19 diagnostic
test. If they develop symptoms, then the symptom-based or test-based strategy should be used.
See: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/return-to- work.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fhealthcare- facilities%2Fhcp-return-work.html
6. Reporting and Surveillance: All confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19 must be reported to design, inform, and evaluate control and prevention efforts. Cases are reported by military public health personnel to BOTH: 1) military and 2) civilian public health authorities. Military service members and other beneficiaries must be reported through military public health authorities via the Disease Reporting System internet (DRSi) in coordination with the Service-specific public health chain of command. All cases must also be reported to the supporting local or state health department according to state requirements. All DoD medical reporting entities should report cases of COVID-19 to the DRSi using the "COVID-19" and answer all event-related questions in the report. Cases must be classified according to the most recent DoD case definition for COVID-19.
WHOLE OF GOVERNMENT RESPONSE IN COORDINATION OF RESOURCES
On 13 Mar 2020, President Trump declared a nationwide emergency under Sec. 501(b) of the Stafford Act, increasing support to HHS in this role as the lead federal agency for the federal government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Under this declaration, FEMA, in coordination with HHS, was empowered to assist state, local, tribal, territorial governments and other eligible entities to access resources made available through the Stafford Act.
 Medium-risk exposures generally include HCP who had prolonged close contact with patients with
 COVID-19 (beginning 48 hours before onset of symptoms) who were wearing a cloth face covering or
 facemask while HCP nose and mouth were exposed to material potentially infectious with the virus
 causing COVID-19. Some low-risk exposures are considered medium-risk depending on the type of
 care activity performed.
 Low-risk exposures generally refer to brief interactions with patients with COVID-19 (beginning 48
 hours before onset of symptoms) or prolonged close contact with patients (beginning 48 hours before
 onset of symptoms) who were wearing a cloth face covering or facemask for source control while HCP
 were wearing a facemask or respirator.
 No identifiable risk. HCP with no direct patient contact and no entry into active patient management
 areas who adhere to routine safety precautions do not have a risk of exposure to COVID-19.
        Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 72

Clinical Management of COVID-19
HHS has many resources to leverage in the federal response to COVID-19, including the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS). The SNS has ventilators, medications, personal protective equipment and other important equipment and supplies that may be requested for COVID-19 response where state and local resources are overwhelmed or anticipated to be overwhelmed. SNS depots are located around the country by region. There is a Defense Coordinator at regional FEMA offices to coordinate requests to/from civilian and military hospitals and other entities for resources. MTFs can identify anticipated shortages and push a request through their local unit Crisis Action Team to the Regional FEMA Defense Coordinator for items in the SNS. It is recommended that facilities leverage available resources before running out of critical items such as PPE.

ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
The Military Health System (MHS) has been on the cutting edge with providing healthcare services with respect to the COVID 19 pandemic. Responding to the COVID pandemic highlights the importance of medicine. But along with it can come significant questions and concerns regarding the availability of staff, resources, and equipment, particularly as we watch in the news what the private healthcare sector is experiencing. DODI Instruction 6025.27, Medical Ethics in the Military Health System, November 8, 2017, and DHA IPM DHA IPM 18-012: The DoD Medical Ethics Program (DoDMEP) in the Military Health System (MHS) - Extended, provide the framework for a medical ethics program within the MHS. Early in the nation's response efforts, private sector healthcare personnel raised concerns about the potential for the scarcity of resources and patient triage. In turn, the Defense Medical Ethics Center outlined one methodology for analyzing these issues and provided that advice to some MTFs. The MHS did not see similar concerns arise regarding resources and has consistently been able to meet all the medical resourcing needs to provide medical care to its patients. The DoD does not endorse any one specific method for addressing ethical issues that may face MTF leadership. Every situation is different and based on unique facts, circumstances and applicable law.
MHS Principles of Medical Ethics
The MHS embraces the principles of professional ethics of America’s health care professions whose members are represented in the Military Services. Codes of ethics developed by health care professional organizations recognize responsibility to patients first and foremost and to society. The MHS views the responsibilities of health care personnel and military professionals as mutually reinforcing. Members of the MHS will:
1. Provide competent health care with compassion and respect for human dignity and rights. All individuals are treated with respect and tolerance. Discrimination on the basis of age, sexual orientation, gender, race, ethnicity, language, disease, disability, religion, or rank is forbidden because it is inconsistent with the ideals and principles of the MHS.
2. Uphold the standards of professionalism. Members must be honest in all professional interactions; support open and honest communication among members of the health care team and promote the utmost professionalism of all health care colleagues.
3. Advocate for the best possible health interests of patients while respecting the law and lawful military authority.
4. Respect the rights of patients, colleagues, and other health care personnel, and safeguard patient confidences and privacy within the constraints of the law.
5. Complete appropriate education and training, as necessary, and provide competent and ethical health care.
6. Support patient-centered decision-making; engaging patients, surrogate decision-makers, and members of the
health care team in decisions, as appropriate.
7. Use the expertise of the health professions to minimize the incidence and severity of injuries and illnesses.
8. Consider the context of local culture, custom, capabilities, and sustainment in overseas humanitarian and
disaster relief activities and use available resources to achieve the greatest good for the greatest number.
     Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 73

Clinical Management of COVID-19
9. Uphold responsibilities under the law in caring for enemy combatants. Responsibilities include, but are not limited to:
a. Not participating in or acquiescing to torture or cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment or punishment in battlefield or detention setting.
b. Reporting to appropriate authorities all suspected violations of these obligations.
10. Regard responsibility to the patient as a primary responsibility, but recognize there may be extraordinary
circumstances associated with the mission or military necessity that may require additional considerations and ethical consultation.
OTHER CONSIDERATIONS RELATED TO COVID-19
Facilities.
Medical Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Systems.
1. DHA Facilities Enterprise recommends maintaining building ventilation systems in balance and compliant. Attempts to adjust without professional mechanical engineering support may cause harm and rework later.
2. Medical facilities (hospitals/clinics) or administrative facilities are recommended not to alter the HVAC system operations or filtration in any way due to the outbreak of COVID-19.
3. Building maintenance personnel should not be exposed to COVID-19 unless they are physically in the same room as an infected person or come in contact with surfaces that have not been disinfected ( such as air filters). No special COVID-19 PPE is required for maintenance personnel unless they are charged with disinfecting surfaces or working where infected persons may have deposited live virus. In those cases, the maintenance personnel should follow CDC guidelines.
4. Although it is not known exactly how long the virus can survive on a surface outside the human carrier, some reports suggest up to 4 days on some materials.
5. If a maintenance worker becomes infected with COVID-19, it is recommend to clean all surfaces the worker may have been in contact with for the past 7 days. A review of all work orders completed by the infected maintenance staff will aid in discovering where and when the employee contacted other surfaces.
6. DHA Facilities Enterprise does NOT recommend increasing filter media such as changing Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) rated filters to High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) if it is being done purely in hope of stopping the spread of COVID-19. MTFs should not add higher rated filters to existing HVAC systems without proper engineering management since the HVAC system may become imbalanced which could result in loss of isolation rooms. Care must to be taken not to exceed the design performance of the HVAC as it will likely reduce equipment life with little or no positive impact.
7. The use of Ultraviolet (UV) lights in the HVAC system (e.g., AHU or ductwork) is not recommended for COVID mitigation.
8. The use of mobile or fixed air scrubber with integral HEPA or
9. There are many new and evolving technologies coming out of industry today as a result of the COVID pandemic that claim to have outstanding results in mitigating COVID-19 viruses. Many of these systems are either experimental or have not been proven in the healthcare setting. DHA FE cannot advocate the use these systems at this time. Should a MTF wants to install a new technology, we recommend a multi- discipline support team with engineers, infection control, and industrial hygiene practitioners to review and validate the product before purchasing to ensure it meets the building’s requirements, is maintainable, and can produce the desired mitigation for the MTF.
      be cautious in discharging exhaust air to the outside of the building or into the return air system.
Ultra-Low Particulate Air (ULPA) filter may be
 used to increase the air changes in a room. Air scrubbers when used to create negative pressure rooms must

Consideration for the use of Powered Air Purifying Respirators (PAPRs) as a COVID-19 Respiratory Protection Strategy 22 April 2020 DRAFT NOTE: This document was adapted from UNMC - Nebraska Medicine COVID-19 PPE
Guidance for Extended Use and Limited Reuse of Disposable Facemasks, Respirators and Protective Eyewear
Introduction: PAPRs are reusable respirators that are loose-fitting hoods or helmets. Caution should be applied with use of PAPRs in surgical settings due to concerns that the blower exhaust and exhaled air may contaminate the sterile field. The FDA issued an update Mar 2020 to address NIOSH-approved air purifying respirators for use in health care settings during the COVID-19 emergency available for review at the following link: https://www.fda.gov/media/135763/download. Facilities using elastomeric respirators and PAPRs are required to have up-to-date cleaning and disinfection procedures to facilitate protection against infectious agents. Recommendations: This document provides an overview of current industry recommendations for consideration. Such recommendations are not all-inclusive, and decision–making must address the unique readiness challenges and concerns faced at each individual facility.
 Staff are required to receive training on correct use of PAPRs.
o Training ensures HCPs are knowledgeable and proficient in the donning and doffing of PAPR and other
PPE prior to engaging in patient care. In addition, during practice, HCPs and their trainers will assess
their proficiency and comfort with performing required duties while wearing PAPR and other PPE.  A trained observer is required.
o The observer should be a dedicated and knowledgeable individual with the responsibility of ensuring adherence to the entire donning and doffing process, including disposal of used PPE. The sequence and actions involved in each donning and doffing step are critical, therefore a trained observer must read aloud to the HCP each step in the procedure checklist and visually confirm, document that the step has been completed correctly, and provide immediate corrective instruction if the HCP is not following the recommended steps.
 The following supplies are gathered in preparation for PAPR use:
o One pair of extended cuff gloves (two pairs if practicing double gloving technique) o One long-sleeve gown
o One PAPR*
o One PAPR hood
o One airflow indicator
*Note: The PAPR must be inspected and a function check completed in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions for use. DO NOT USE and remove from service if airflow does not reach six cubic feet/minute (CFM). Change the filters and repeat the function test. If after changing filter the function test fails, take out of service.
   
PPE must remain in place and worn correctly for the duration of exposure to potentially contaminated areas. Avoid adjusting PPE during patient care. If PAPR malfunctions during patient care, the HCP must move immediately to the doffing area to assess the situation.
Donning PAPR Equipment:
 Healthcare facilities that decide to add additional PPE or modify this PPE guidance, must consider the risk versus benefit of any modification, and train HCPs on modified donning and doffing procedures.
 The practice of double–gloving provides an extra layer of safety during direct patient care and during the PPE removal process, however more than two pairs of gloves can make it more difficult to perform patient care duties.
 PAPR and all other PPE must be donned correctly in proper order before entry into the patient care area. Donning activities must be directly observed by a trained observer. The following steps for donning must be followed:
1. Perform hand hygiene
2. Don PAPR
a. Don PAPR belt with assistance
b. Position PAPR around waist
c. Fold/tuck extra belt webbing into belt
d. Test range of motion

following steps must be followed for doffing:
Doffing will begin in the patient’s room. Doffing partner will be prepared to assist outside patient’s room by performing hand hygiene and donning the surgical mask and gloves. Doffing partner will prepare the area outside the room, and gather the following supplies:
a. Intravenous (IV) Pole
b. Disinfectant wipes
c. Biohazard bags
d. Plastic bag
HCP performs hand hygiene over gloves
Gown is removed by pulling away from the shoulders, taking care to avoid jerking motion; may remove gloves in conjunction with the gown (if using the double–gloving technique, remove outer pair of gloves prior to removing gown)
If gloves are still on, remove gloves using the “glove in glove” technique
Perform hand hygiene
HCP will leave the patient’s room
Keeping the blower motor ON, HCP will disconnect belt, and hand it to the doffing partner
Doffing partner will hang belt on the IV pole
HCP completes hand hygiene
Doffing partner thoroughly disinfects PAPR hose and motor using approved disinfectant wipe
Doffing Partner will tell HCP that the hose will be disconnected from PAPR motor
Doffing partner will hold the hose and instruct HCP to lean forward and remove the hood
a. HCP will reach under the sides of the hood and carefully remove the hood over and off head
b. Alternative method: HCP will pinch the crown of the hood and carefully pull the hood over and
off head
Doffing partner will place the hood and hose into plastic bag. *Note: the hood may be reused if supplies are low
HCP will complete hand hygiene and exit the area
Doffing partner will perform hand hygiene

Decontamination of N95 Respirators: 24 April 2020 DRAFT Situation and Background
COVID-19 has caused significant disruption in the manufacturing of N95 filtering facemask respirators (FFRs), subsequently generating a need for strategies to decontaminate for reuse. To ensure existing resources are leveraged effectively, and Military Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) are equipped to optimally care for patients in a crisis situation, an evaluation of alternative strategies is warranted.
Assessment
There are currently four strategies for decontamination of N95 FFRs. These include high–concentration hydrogen peroxide (e.g., the Battelle Decontamination System), hydrogen peroxide sterilization systems (STERRAD, STERIZONE, STERIS, and Sterilucent), heat and humidity, and ultraviolet (UV) decontamination (e.g., Xenex). The implementation of each of these strategies carries with it unique benefits and challenges, as highlighted below:
 On 28 MAR 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for
1
 FDA has now issued Emergency use Authorization to four VHP sterilizer companies.2–5 These authorizations are only for specific models and do not include all systems that various companies make. A benefit associated with these devices, is that many MTFs already have them, but the disadvantage is the decontamination capacity of each system is anywhere from 10-20 masks every 30-60 minutes depending on the system. Another disadvantage is that FDA requires single-user per masks and STERRAD and STERIZONE are only recommended for two decontamination cycles, while STERIS and Sterilucent are authorized for up to ten decontamination cycles.
 Heat and Humidity has been proposed as an option for decontamination of N95 FFRs. This method has not been authorized by FDA. Various studies have demonstrated that under the right circumstances of about 70- 85 °C with relative humidity of 50-85% for 60 minutes, inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 is likely. Users are cautioned that if humidity is not maintained, viable viruses were present on the mask. The advantage of this strategy is that systems that can achieve these parameters are inexpensive and widely available, and most N95 FFRs have maintained good fit and filter performance for up to 3 cycles. The disadvantage is that mask integrity as it relates to decontamination cycles varies based on the make and model of N95 FFR, and therefore facilities must assure that the masks that are being decontaminated were studied within those parameters.
 The use of UV–C disinfection is now gaining recognition in the literature as a potentially viable strategy for N95 FFR decontamination during this crisis6, and a number of reputable hospital systems have publicly supported the practice. ECRI has provided communications indicating this approach is acceptable as a last resort, and additional information regarding use of this method is available at the following link: https://www.nebraskamed.com/sites/default/files/documents/covid-19/n-95-decon-process.pdf Currently some MTFs have developed protocols and may already be implementing this decontamination strategy. The advantages of using this process is that many masks could be decontaminated in fairly short period of time, but numerous disadvantages should be considered when implementing this strategy:
o The UV–C light systems are not regulated as medical devices by FDA, and therefore must be validated for appropriate output.
o UV–C light must shine directly on all surfaces, which is difficult to accomplish with curved masks (any shadows may leave masks still contaminated).
o UV-C light must be delivered at proper dose. This should be verified by a UV-C-specific sensor. o UV light degrades mask components, and determining the number of decontamination cycles
depends on the amount of UV light delivered per cycle.
o It is likely that due to kinking, straps would not receive proper amount of UV–C light. Experts
recommend that decontamination of straps is conducted manually.
  the Battelle Decontamination System.
with up to 20 decontamination cycles per mask. Additionally, FDA does not require masks to be returned to the same user. A unique challenge associated with this product is that implementation requires transport of the respirators to and from the decontamination site, and therefore requires logistics support.
This system can decontaminate thousands of N95 FFRs at one time
 Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 90

Clinical Management of COVID-19
The following considerations must be taken into account if using any decontamination strategy:
 Decontaminated compatible N95 FFRs are not sterile, and in most cases (with exception of Battelle’s
method) must go back to the original wearer.
 All hydrogen peroxide systems cannot decontaminate masks that contain cellulose-based materials
 Each of the aforementioned systems have different requirements regarding the number of times they can
be used.
 If any of the N95 FFRs are visibly soiled (e.g., blood, dried sputum, makeup, body fluids) they must be
disposed of.
 If a good seal cannot be maintained, the mask must be disposed of.
 Any individual handling contaminated respirators must wear full personal protective equipment (PPE),
including an N95 FFR and eye protection.
Recommendation
Leadership should consider hydrogen peroxide sterilization systems as a first line decontamination strategy, and avoid the use of UV light and heat and humidity strategies for decontamination until proper validation of effectiveness is achieved. If MTFs have concerns regarding an inability to maintain adequate supply of N95 respirators, the DHA IPC Tiger Team should be contacted at the following e–mail to address such concerns: dha.ncr.clinic-support.list.ipc-group@mail.mil

Intubation Barrier Strategies for Use during the COVID–19 Pandemic: 23 April DRAFT
Situation and Background
Concerns have been raised over the need to implement additional strategies to prevent COVID–19 disease transmission during patient intubation. To address these concerns, a number of products and strategies have been developed by facilities and vendors. To date, there are no clear industry standards or guidance that definitively recommend one approach as more effective over another. Given the lack of clear guidance, careful review and evaluation of each method is warranted prior to consideration for implementation.
Assessment
Although there are additional prototypes and products currently in use, three primary strategies for barrier protection during endotracheal intubation include the COVID-19 Airway Management Isolation Chamber (CAMIC), the Aerosol Box, and the Intubation Shield. Each of these products/strategies maintain unique benefits and challenges with implementation, as highlighted below:
 The CAMIC is constructed primarily out of PVC pipes and a clear polyethylene bag. One unique benefit of this approach is that its flexible structure is believed to allow for improved provider mobility during intubation. Caution must be applied in setting up this system, as it is designed to be hooked to suction on one side, and air or oxygen input on the other. If both ports are accidentally hooked up to oxygen or air, there is a potential to increase aerosolization of the virus. The CAMIC is relatively inexpensive to construct, and initial testing supports this method as an effective means of reducing respiratory droplet spread during
1
o At the point of generation, dispose of polyethylene bag and wipe down the PVC pipe with a hospital–approved germicidal wipe.
o Place wiped down equipment in a transport container and transport to soiled utility room.
o Obtain 1:10 premixed bleach disinfectant and submerge pieces for 5 minutes (refer to guidelines
provided as an appendix to this document regarding premixed bleach disinfectant). o Remove equipment and rinse, ensuring removal of any residue.
o Dry for 24 hours in an upright position to ensure drainage of remaining water.
o Place in peel pouch and return to clean storage.
 The Aerosol Box is constructed from acrylic or transparent polycarbonate, and is intended to serve as an additional barrier for protection while allowing the provider to insert their hands through pre–drilled holes

 The Intubation Shield is a single-use/disposable, clear plastic drape placed over the patient during intubation. The Intubation Shield can be utilized as a single–method for protection, or in conjunction with additional barrier strategies. One unique benefit of the Intubation Shield is that since it is disposed of after a single use, there are no cleaning requirements. Caution must be applied with this product, understanding that it may pose a risk of suffocation if left in place without direct supervision (clipping the sheet to an IV pole may reduce this risk). Healthcare workers must receive proper training in the use and supervision of these barriers.
Recommendation
Military Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) leadership, in collaboration with frontline providers, may consider each of the aforementioned strategies as options for implementing additional barrier precautions during AGPs such as endotracheal intubation. Healthcare workers must be trained properly on the use of these barriers, and operators should be ready to abandon their use should airway management prove difficult. Decision–making should take into account each MTF’s existing resources and needs. Commanders must pay close attention that proper cleaning procedures are implemented for use these products, as well as any strategy involving reuse of materials.

   When mixing bleach, wear gloves and eye protection.
 Consider a waterproof apron or gown to avoid getting on clothing.
 Mix bleach in a well ventilated area.
 Mix bleach using cold water, as hot water decomposes it.
 Do not mix with other chemicals.
 Discard after each use.
 If bleach is reused, mix in an opaque bottle/container and discard after each shift/day.
 Clearly label and date the container of the bleach solution.
 Keep diluted bleach covered and protected from sunlight, and if possible in a dark container.
Procedure for Disinfection
 Items will be cleaned with a 0.5% to 0.6% sodium hypochlorite (i.e. “1:10 bleach”) solution, then thoroughly rinsed or wiped with clean water to remove any residual and then dried.
 Sodium hypochlorite solutions (mixed/diluted) will gradually lose strength, so fresh solutions must be prepared frequently.
 Diluted solutions of bleach will be replaced after each use.
 Items soaking for 5 minutes must be in a well vented room.
 Proper PPE must be worn.
o Wear disposable gloves when cleaning and disinfecting surfaces.
o Gloves should be discarded after each cleaning. If reusable gloves are used, those gloves should be
dedicated for cleaning and disinfection of surfaces for COVID-19 and should not be used for other
purposes.
o Clean hands immediately after gloves are removed.
o If surfaces are dirty, they should be cleaned using a detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
 Allow proper ventilation during and after application.
 Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser.
 Unexpired household bleach will be effective against coronaviruses when properly diluted.

USE OF MASKS IN THE COMMUNITY SETTING
As COVID-19 extends its reach into local communities throughout the United States, the use of masks in public is now a topic of debate. The leading health organizations in the world offer mixed recommendations regarding the use of masks in the community setting. To address this topic, I will look at the components of droplet-producing events (e.g. sneezing), CDC and WHO mask recommendations, the performance of different types of masks, and finally how to care for masks in the community setting.
What’s in a Sneeze?
High-speed recordings of droplets following a sneeze demonstrate turbulent clouds, with the largest droplets settling 1-2 meters away. Smaller droplets remain suspended, carrying them as far as 6-8 meters away from the individual. The lifetime of these suspended droplets, particularly in warm and moist air, could extend as much as

At the time of this edition’s publication, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) argues that citizens can utilize cloth face coverings in various settings, such as grocery stores, where social distancing can be more difficult. The CDC emphasizes that this measure protects those around you by limiting the spread of droplets from an otherwise asymptomatic individual. Their guidance regarding cloth face coverings include a snug fit, secured with ear-loops or ties, be multi-layered, and may be laundered without damage. Finally, the CDC cautions against placing masks on children younger than 2 or on any individual with trouble breathing or who would otherwise have difficulty
5
The World Health Organization (WHO), however, recommends against the use of any type of mask in the community setting. They portend that there is no evidence that masks can prevent individuals in the community from contracting a respiratory virus. Furthermore, the WHO argues the use of masks will create complacency regarding other preventive measures. Ultimately, they recommend decision-makers keep in mind the purpose of using masks, who in the local population is at risk, characteristics of the community setting, the feasibility of producing and

With particles of COVID-19 measuring 60-140 nanometers (0.06-0.140 microns)7, there is a reasonable concern regarding how effective masks, particularly cloth ones, are in blocking the virus. One recent laboratory trial assessed the effectiveness of N95, surgical masks, homemade masks, and cloth masks in filtering avian influenza virus in aerosols. Ma and colleagues found N95 masks 99.98% of the virus, while medical masks blocked 97.14%, and homemade masks (1 layer of polyester cloth with 4 layers of kitchen paper) could block 95.15%. They cautioned that

One prospective, randomized control trial from 2015 evaluated 1607 healthcare workers across seventy-four hospital wards with the use of medical and cloth masks. They found the rate of influenza-like illness was significantly higher in the cloth mask arm (RR = 13) compared to those wearing medical masks. They additionally conducted a sodium chloride filtration test, demonstrating a 97% penetration rate in cloth masks, compared to 44% in medical

Cotton was 69% efficient for Bacillus and 50% efficient for Bacteriophage, compared to 96% and 89% respectively for a surgical mask. Next, healthy volunteers were asked to cough twice into a 0.5m3 box. Investigators took air samples for the next five minutes, and the median colony forming units (CFUs) were measured for air and settle plates within the box. The reduction of CFUs was statistically significant for both the surgical masks and for the cloth masks; however, the surgical mask was three times better at blocking the transmission of expelled microorganisms. Davies and colleagues concluded poor fit will reduce effectiveness and that homemade masks are not only a last resort, but they would

Current recommendations that members of the community wear masks in settings where social distancing measures may be more difficult to maintain. Providers and or healthcare professionals must emphasize using the masks as a way of further limiting the spread of COVID from asymptomatic patients, rather than as a means of protecting yourself from others. Masks of any type should be form-fitting and frequently laundered or sterilized. Surgical masks should generally be reserved for healthcare personnel; however, there are some grass-roots efforts by military garrisons to produce reusable masks for service members and dependents. Finally, members of the community must understand that masks are part of a multi-faceted approach to reducing viral transmission. Frequent hand-washing, not touching your face with unwashed hands, and maintaining social distancing practices remain vital in the fight against SARS-CoV-2.

 APPENDIX C : ADULT PRONE POSITIONING PROTOCOL EXAMPLE*
*Adapted from University Medical Center (Las Vegas, NV)
Procedure for patient preparation prior to proning:
1. Obtain an order from the Fellow or Attending physician to place patient in the prone position. The order should include:
a. Proper sedation/pain medications and paralytic agents if necessary.
b. Length of time for each pronation cycle (patient should be in prone position a minimum of 16 hours, with a
return to the supine position at least once a day).
c. Prone positioning should be performed within the first 24 hours of the diagnosis of severe hypoxemia.
2. Explain proning procedure and benefits to patient and family members when present.
3. Prior to proning patient, make sure the following criteria have been met and necessary equipment is made available:
a. Patient is mechanically ventilated via a secured endotracheal tube (ETT) with inline suction.
b. RT is at bedside to evaluate securement of ETT with commercial tape and to place bite block as needed.
Twill may be used in addition to the tape if additional securement is needed. Do not secure ETT with a
commercial securement device (i.e. Hollister).
c. Confirm patient intravenous access including central and arterial lines; verify lines are secure in place.
d. Remove ECG leads from anterior of torso; obtain new leads to place posteriorly once patient is prone.
Electrocardiogram leads can be placed in the lateral limb position (left and right deltoid midaxillary line and left and right 12th intercostal space at the midaxillary line). The virtual lead (V1 or chest lead) can be placed on the dorsal surface.
e. Consider adhesive foam pads (i.e. Mepilex) to apply to boney prominences such as forehead, bilateral shoulders, chest, iliac crests and knees to prevent pressure ulcers.
f. Obtain positioning pillows, blanket rolls or foam prone positioning kit from materials management or supply room.
g. Continuous SpO2 monitoring.
h. Foley catheter and oral gastric tube secured in place.
i. Use fecal management system if needed.
j. It is reasonable to provide enteral feedings while patient is in prone position. Elevation of head of bed in
reverse Trendelenburg position helps reduce the risk of gastric aspiration. Post pyloric tubes are preferred.
k. Lubricate patient’s eyes prior to proning, then every six hours and as needed (Provider order needed).
l. Assess and document pain and provide adequate sedation and pain management throughout the
procedure.
m. Patients may also require neuromuscular blocking agent during proning.
n. Remove head board and ensure bed brake is on.
o. RT will perform and document a complete vent check including auscultation of bilateral lung sounds,
ventilator settings, ETT positioning/depth, patient tidal volumes and ETT cuff pressures pre and post turn.
Procedure of manual pronation:
1. Assemble a minimum of a 5-person team consisting of at least on RT and the patient’s RN. RT is to manage airway protection at the head of the bed and the other team members are positioned on either side of the bed to manually prone the patient. A fellow or attending physician should be present for the first turn.
2. Correctly position all tubes, taking into account the direction of the turn.
3. Lines inserted in the upper torso are aligned with either shoulder, exception is chest tubes or large bore tubes.
4. Tubes in the lower torso are aligned with either leg and extended off the bed.
5. Always initially turn the patient in the direction of the ventilator.
Procedure for proper patient positioning (see diagram below):
1. Head and Neck positioning:
Place patient’s head on a foam head positioner, which allows for the patient’s head in a neutral position. Otherwise, support the patient’s head in a rotated position paying attention to avoid pressure to the eyes and ears. Provide range of motion to the patient’s head at least every hour, maintaining ETT tube alignment. Reposition head every two hours, head should be turned to the up are while in swimmer’s pose, to avoid traction on the brachial plexus. Coordinate with RT to be present to maintain the airway while repositioning the head every two hours. This may

Clinical Management of COVID-19
require positioning the ventilator at the head of the bed rather than on one side of the bed to allow for the head reposition. Raise the head enough to provide for proper spinal alignment: avoid hyperextension or flexion of the cervical spine. Ensure the eyes have no pressure on the orbits and ears are properly aligned, flat and not folded.
2. Arm positioning:
If using foam prone positioning kit, place patient’s arms in foam positioners. While the patient is in a side lying position, gently position the arms in a swimmer’s pose. The simmers pose entails the up are is in a supported, flexed position at the level of the shoulder and the down arm is parallel to the body in a position of comfort. When the arm is in the up position, keep the shoulder in a neutral position, abducted to 90 degrees and the elbow flexed at 90 degrees. Utilize pillows or blanket rolls to prevent hyperextension of the shoulder and to ensure the weight of the arm is supported. Note: Head position should be turned to the up arm while in swimmer’s pose, to avoid traction on the brachial plexus.
a. Alternate the arm and head position every two hours with the patient in a side lying position and provide passive range of motion exercise to all joints of the upper and lower extremities.
3. Patient positioning:
a. Manually reposition the patient a minimum of every 2 hours with a slight right lateral-pillow support
position (20-30°) to prone (flat) to a slight left lateral-pillow supported position (20-30°) and back to prone position. The use of automatic bed rotation is not a replacement for manual repositioning.
Note: When placing the patient in the lateral-pillow support position, coordinate head and arm in the up position toward the tilted side (Do not use foam wedges for lateral turns).
b. During lateral turns inspect the skin and positioning of the tubes, lines and catheters (tubing and penis) and reposition accordingly, i.e. Foley catheters, chest tubes, IV lines, etc.
4. Leg positioning:
While in prone and/or lateral prone position float the knees with a pillow (be careful not to cause hyperextension of the hip), and place a foam roller, pillow or blanket roll under the ankle area to elevate the toes and prevent tension on the tendons in the foot and ankle region.
5. Tilt the patient into reverse Trendelenburg: Goal is 30 degrees, as patient tolerates.
6. Alternative position of the arms for comfort or if swimmer’s position is contraindicated.
For example, the patient, family or PT/OT one-time evaluation report history of rotator cuff tear, stroke, nerve damage, osteoarthritis of shoulder complex, history of clavicle fracture, hyper flexible joints.
a. Arms can be left in the side lying position aligned with the body and repositioned ever two hours to a slightly abducted positon.
Patient monitoring and care:
1. Time patient is prone/supine:
a. It is recommended in the literature that patient is placed in the prone position for a minimum of 16 hours. The timing for prone cycling requires a physician order and is always situational. Patients should be returned to supine position for up to four hours, once per day preferably early AM to allow the interdisciplinary team time to assess while in supine position. While in supine position, reassessment of oxygenation, skin assessment and other relevant exam elements should occur. If the patient does not tolerate being supine (i.e. requiring increased ventilator settings, decreasing PaO2/FiO2 ration, hemodynamically unstable or decreasing SpO2/PaO2) return patient to the prone position.
b. Patients in prone position should receive the same standard of care as a patient that is supine (i.e. oral care,
 Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 99

Clinical Management of COVID-19
urinary catheter care, skin care, eye care, suctioning, etc.).
c. Discuss supine position tolerance and PaO2/FiO2 ratio in bedside report and during interdisciplinary rounds.
d. Ongoing assessment of how the patient is tolerating prone therapy and repositioning; documentation of all
vital signs, capnography, patient and family education, length of time prone, patient’s response to turning
supine, any adverse events that occur and changes in the patient’s condition.
e. Primary RN will coordinate with RT to re-secure ETT when the patient is supine and assist with turns,
checking cuff pressures and tube placement before and after repositioning the patient; coordinate with
radiology for chest x-ray when supine.
f. Monitor all tubes, lines, drains and catheters throughout the repositioning process and continue airway
management, suctioning oral and ETT secretions.
g. Continue to evaluate enteral nutrition tolerance and maintain reverse Trendelenburg to help prevent
ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP).
h. RT to change ETT tape at least once a day or more frequently if necessary due to facial swelling.
i. PaO2/FiO2 ratios should be calculated every day and when ventilator settings have been changed in order
to identify candidates for returning to the supine position early.
Consider discontinuation of the prone position if:
1. The patient no longer shows a positive response to the position change or mechanical ventilation support has been optimized.
2. The patient’s PaO2/FiO2 ratio is >200 on less than 50% FiO2 and PEEP ≤10 cm of water.
Complications related to prone positioning:
1. Unplanned extubation
a. Lines pulled
b. Tubes kinked
c. Hemodynamic instability
d. Facial edema
e. Pressure ulcers
f. Aspiration
g. Corneal abrasions

*Adapted from University Medical Center (Las Vegas, NV)
Guidelines for Extubation of COVID-19 patients:
 Extubations require 2 HCP’s one to hold the mask while the second extubates the patient.
 Whenever possible patient should be placed in negative pressure rooms, and use cube extubation device
with plastic shield
 This is considered an aerosolized procedure so proper N-95 masks should be worn, along with goggles,
gowns and gloves.
 Place patient at 30 degrees and place nasal cannula on patient at 5-L/M
 Suction ETT and mouth prior to deflating the cuff
 Loosen ETT holder and place anesthesia face mask with HEPA filter attached over the patients nose and
mouth leaving space for ETT exiting under the face mask
 IF anesthesia bag is used, use a low oxygen flow, consider attempting to exubate at end of expiration
 Deflate ETT cuff and extubate while maintaining face-mask seal
 Maintain two-handed mask seal until any immediate post-extubation coughing has subsided.
 Remove anesthesia mask and place procedure mask over the patient while wearing nasal cannula oxygen.

APPENDIX M : PREPARATION AND CLEANING OF ULTRASOUND ROOMS IN THE CONTEXT OF COVID-19
Reference: ISUOG Safety Statement: Safe performance of obstetric and gynecological scans and equipment cleaning in the context of COVID-19
Ultrasound units:
Preparation and cleaning of ultrasound room for all patients
The survival of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated viruses (including COVID-19) on dry inanimate surfaces, such as ultrasound systems, is between 48 and 96 h. The ultrasound room should be cleaned thoroughly each morning and all contents should be wiped with a compatible low-level disinfectant (LLD), including the ultrasound monitor, computer keyboard and mouse, stretcher rails, transducer holder, gel container, door handles, cabinet knobs, light switches, chairs and counter tops.
• The number of transducers connected to the ultrasound machine should be reduced to a minimum, usually one transabdominal and one transvaginal, and all other transducers should be stored safely in a clean closed cabinet and brought out as needed.
• All unnecessary accessories in the room should be removed and, where possible, stored in the cabinets.
• Fabric-covered chairs should be replaced with hard-surface chairs that can be wiped.
• Where possible, replace all washable linen, such as towels, pillow covers and sheets, with disposable covers.
• Ultrasound transducers and cables should be cleaned (as recommended below) every morning and this should
also be performed after each scan.
• The patient bed or couch should be wiped with a LLD prior to replacing the disposable paper cover.
• The disposable paper cover should be removed with gloved hands and folded and disposed of immediately at
the end of each examination.
• Ensure that the highly touched surfaces (e.g. keyboard, cord and screen) of the ultrasound machine are
thoroughly cleaned after each examination.
• At the end of the day, soiled linen should be handled using two pairs of gloves and disposed of in the
appropriate container without shaking the linen. The room and equipment should undergo terminal cleaning using a LLD. Hands should be washed for 20 sec afterwards.
Preparation and cleaning of ultrasound equipment for all patients
The transducer and ultrasound equipment must be cleaned with a compatible LLD after each patient, in accordance with local guidelines.
Preparation and cleaning of ultrasound equipment after performing an examination in a suspected of confirmed COVID-19 case
SARS coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus and endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces, such as metal, glass or plastic, for up to 9 days, but can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 62–71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 min. Other biocidal agents often used include 0.05–0.2% benzalkonium chloride (Clinell TM) or 0.02% chlorhexidine digluconate.
• Check the required contact time for each product.
Since information about COVID-19 is incomplete, additional use of high-level disinfectants is recommended; however, this advice is manufacturer-specific. High-level disinfectants include ethanol 80-95% (exposure time 30 sec), 2-propanol 75-100% (exposure time 30 sec), 2-propanol and 1-propanol 45% and 30% (exposure time 30 Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 115

sec), sodium hypochlorite 0.21% (Antisapril Blu 2%, exposure time 30 sec), glutaraldehyde 2.5% (exposure time 5 min) and 0.5% (CIDEX OPA, exposure time 2 min), hydrogen peroxide 0.5% (REVITAL-OX RESERT, exposure time 1 min)6.Protective eyewear and gloves should be used when cleaning, disinfecting or sterilizing any equipment.
Preparation and cleaning of ultrasound transducer after performing an examination in a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 case
If feasible, it is recommended to have one (or more) dedicated ultrasound machine(s) for patients with suspected/probable/confirmed COVID-19 infection.
• If the patient must be scanned in the clinic, this should be done at the end of the clinic list, as the room and equipment will subsequently require a deep clean.
• It is imperative to perform hand hygiene once the gloves have been removed.
Guidelines regarding cleaning of ultrasound transducers between patients are available. Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses, which are the least resistant to inactivation by disinfection. The structure of these viruses includes a lipid envelope, which is easily disrupted by most disinfectants suitable for use on ultrasound systems and transducers.
According to the Spaulding classification system, medical devices are classified according to the infection risk they present as non-critical, semi-critical and critical (also referred to as low-risk, medium-risk and high-risk). Non- critical devices present the lowest risk for infection as they come in contact with intact skin, such as transabdominal transducers. Low- or intermediate-level disinfection is recommended, which will eradicate most bacteria (but not bacterial spores) and fungi, as well as certain types of viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Semi-critical devices are those that present a higher risk for infection because of contact with non-intact skin or mucous membranes. Transvaginal transducers belong to this category. High-level disinfection for destruction of all microorganisms, including COVID-19, is recommended and can be performed by means of solutions containing sodium hypochlorite or other disinfectants as detailed above. Critical devices, such as transducers used in invasive procedures, must undergo sterilization as per medical facility guidelines irrespective of whether a probe cover is used.
Preparation of the ultrasound transducer consists of two steps: cleaning and disinfection. Any products used for cleaning or disinfection must be compatible with the ultrasound equipment, as determined by the ultrasound equipment manufacturer. Certain products may damage ultrasound equipment or transducers and invalidate warranties.
1. Cleaning
This is an important first step since any remaining gel can act as a barrier to the disinfectant thus diminishing its efficacy. The USA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines cleaning as ‘the removal of foreign material (e.g., soil, and organic material) from objects and is normally accomplished using water with detergents or enzymatic products’. Ineffective cleaning prior to disinfection can limit the effectiveness of chemical disinfection.
Current guidelines for cleaning transvaginal transducers recommend using running water to remove any residual gel or debris from the probe before cleansing thoroughly the transducer using a damp gauze pad, or other soft cloth, and a small amount of mild nonabrasive liquid soap (approved for use on medical instruments). The use of a small brush especially for the crevices and areas of angulation should be considered, depending on the design of the particular transducer. The transducer should then be rinsed thoroughly with running water and dried with a soft cloth or paper towel.
  Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 116

Clinical Management of COVID-19
Based on the above guidelines, the following steps are recommended for cleaning the transducer, which should be performed wearing disposable gloves:
a. Disconnect the transducer.
b. Remove the transducer cover (if applicable) and dispose of in clinical waste.
c. Rinse the operative end of the transducer with running tap water (NOT the electronic contact end).
d. Clean the transducer with a soft brush and nonabrasive detergent.
e. Rinse the transducer with tap water.
f. Clean the transducer cable with a LLD wipe.
g. Dry with a cloth or towel (residual water can dilute chemical disinfectants, if this is the preferred method).
2. Disinfection
Always refer to your facility’s infection control policies and protocols, as well as the transducer manufacturer’s instruction for use and labels for use. Disinfection practices are evolving constantly, and this is the most current to date. As mentioned above, high-level disinfection is recommended for transvaginal but not transabdominal transducers. Specific product instructions must be consulted. Available methods (current at the time of publication) include:
Chemical ‘wet’ disinfection:
• 2.4–3.2% glutaraldehyde products (such as Cidex, Metricide and Procide).
• Non-glutaraldehyde agents (such as Cidex OPA (o-phthalaldehyde) and Cidex PA (hydrogen peroxide and
peroxyacetic acid).
• Approved multistep disinfectant wipes containing chlorine dioxide, which are used extensively in the UK and
Australia (Tristel Duo®).
• 7.5% hydrogen peroxide solution, which works by producing destructive hydroxyl free radicals. • Sodium hypochlorite 0.21% (Antisapril Blu 2%).
Note that common household bleach (5.25% sodium hypochlorite) diluted to yield 500 parts per million chlorine (10 cc in one L of tap water), although effective it is not recommended by manufacturers because it can potentially cause damage to metal and plastic parts of the transducer. Mention of this disinfectant here does not imply that we consider it to be appropriate, but we are aware that it is used in some settings.
Automated high-level disinfection:
• Antigermix (Germitec, France): the transducer is placed in a closed cabinet and exposed to high-intensity ultraviolet type C radiation.
• Astra VR (CIVCO Medical Solutions, USA): automated disinfection with Cidex OPA and Metricide solutions. • Trophon (Nanosonics, Australia): sonicated hydrogen peroxide mist.
After cleaning, store transducer in a clean closet or its case with foam inset to prevent damage and protect from contamination with dirt, if it is not going to be reused immediately.
